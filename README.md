# LDA
A first project in Unstructured Data Analytics, focused on topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Inspired by George Chen's CMU course on Unstructured Data Analytics (https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/georgech/95-865/).

The Interactive Notebook file is written in Python. Uncomment cells to install necessary packages. Feel free to contact me if you run into difficulties.
