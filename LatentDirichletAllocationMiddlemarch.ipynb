    "Middlemarch, by George Eliot, one of the great novels of the 19th Century, is out of copyright and available for free via Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/). To my shame, I have yet to read it. But what insights can we draw from text analysis? We apply a *topic modeling* approach to this task, utilizing the *Latent Dirichlet Allocation* (LDA) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as exploring and analysing the data, we verify the assertions of Maria Antoniak in her blog (https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2022/07/27/topic-modeling-for-the-people.html) on LDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) It’s fine to use LDA -- we better take this as a given (for the purposes of this project)!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Evaluate the topics by hand -- not having access to human subjects(!), we cannot use either the word intruder or document intruder tests of Hoyle et al. (2021) and Chang et al. (2009) to evaluate the coherence of the resulting topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Test different numbers of topics -- we train our models with 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 topics to start, then use \"qualitative evaluation\" for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Longer documents are better -- this is good for us, as we are analysing the text of a book. Then again, \"Documents that are too long (e.g., entire novels) can result in incoherent topics or topics that reflect different types of themes than topics trained on smaller documents.\" We need to be cognizant of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Tune the parameter controlling the topic distributions -- per Wallach et al. (2009), it’s helpful to tune the parameter governing topics per document distribution but not the parameter governing the words per topic distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Train using Gibbs sampling -- the default sklearn package uses variational Bayes instead of Gibbs sampling. Instead, we'll use the tomotopy package. This also has the advantage of automated topic labelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Keep most stopwords -- this may seem counterintuitive, but Schofield et al. (2017) suggests it's the way to go. We run our models with and without stopwords, in order to compare the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Don't stem -- similarly, Schofield and Mimno (2016), found stemming and lemmatization methods are usually redundant and sometimes harmful, reducing the readability of your topics, lacking interpretability, and conflating terms with different meanings. Again, we run our models with and without stemming and lemmatization for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) Remove duplicates -- while important when dealing with multiple documents, in our case we analyse a single (large) file, so need not worry about removing duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Consider your training set -- again, this is important when dealing with multiple documents, for instance Maria's example of online posts. But in analysing a book we need not worry about restricting the training dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "11) Authorless Topic Models: Use what you already know -- we use the Authorless TMs package (available via MALLET) for preprocessing, to bias our topic models away from known metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "12) Hand-label the topics -- we represent the top words for each topic, guided by domain knowledge. This notebook utilizes automatic topic labelling, but the exercise of labelling topics by hand is also useful. \n",
    " \n",
    "13) Visualisation tips -- Antoniak recommends heatmaps, and improving their legibility by ranking topics by entropy over subsets of the data, while also normalizing the columns. We use pyLDAvis for a wealth of in-built functionality."

      "more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from\r\n",
      "her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss\r\n",
      "Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her\r\n",
      "sister shared. The pride of being ladies had something to do with it: the\r\n",
      "Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably\r\n",
      "“good:” if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would not find\r\n",
      "any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral\r\n",
      "or a clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan\r\n",
      "gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to\r\n",
      "come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family\r\n",
      "estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and\r\n",
      "attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor, naturally regarded\r\n",
      "frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s daughter. Then there was well-bred\r\n",
      "economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted\r\n",
      "from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such\r\n",
      "reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from\r\n",
      "religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have\r\n",
      "determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s sentiments, only\r\n",
      "infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous\r\n",
      "doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea knew many passages of\r\n",
      "Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the destinies of\r\n",
      "mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine\r\n",
      "fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties\r\n",
      "of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in\r\n",
      "gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\r\n",
      "by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly\r\n",
      "include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she was\r\n",
      "enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to\r\n",
      "her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and\r\n",
      "then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it.\r\n",
      "Certainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to\r\n",
      "interfere with her lot, and hinder it from being decided according to custom,\r\n",
      "by good looks, vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the\r\n",
      "elder of the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated,\r\n",
      "since they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans at\r\n",
      "once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and afterwards in a\r\n",
      "Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way\r\n",
      "to remedy the disadvantages of their orphaned condition.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with their\r\n",
      "uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous opinions, and\r\n",
      "uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years, and was held in this\r\n",
      "part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind. Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather: it was only\r\n",
      "safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions, and that he would\r\n",
      "spend as little money as possible in carrying them out. For the most\r\n",
      "glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has\r\n",
      "been seen lax about all his own interests except the retention of his\r\n",
      "snuff-box, concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance;\r\n",
      "but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues, turning\r\n",
      "sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his way of “letting things be”\r\n",
      "on his estate, and making her long all the more for the time when she would be\r\n",
      "of age and have some command of money for generous schemes. She was regarded as\r\n",
      "an heiress; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their\r\n",
      "parents, but if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke’s estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\r\n",
      "seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late conduct\r\n",
      "on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and of that gorgeous\r\n",

      "before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all\r\n",
      "offers. A young lady of some birth and fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a\r\n",
      "brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought\r\n",
      "herself living in the time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting\r\n",
      "like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a\r\n",
      "wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application\r\n",
      "of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of\r\n",
      "saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in\r\n",
      "such fellowship. Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great\r\n",
      "safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers, was\r\n",
      "generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and innocent-looking, while\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her religion, too unusual and striking.\r\n",
      "Poor Dorothea! compared with her, the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and\r\n",
      "worldly-wise; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which\r\n",

      "Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by this\r\n",
      "alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with\r\n",
      "it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback. She loved the\r\n",
      "fresh air and the various aspects of the country, and when her eyes and cheeks\r\n",
      "glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee. Riding was\r\n",
      "an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she\r\n",
      "felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\r\n",
      "renouncing it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it was pretty\r\n",
      "to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether\r\n",
      "superior to her own, and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from\r\n",
      "some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be\r\n",
      "in love with Celia: Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly\r\n",
      "considered from Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be\r\n",
      "good for Celia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\r\n",
      "would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all her\r\n",
      "eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas about\r\n",
      "marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker, if\r\n",
      "she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in\r\n",
      "matrimony; or John Milton when his blindness had come on; or any of the other\r\n",
      "great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an\r\n",
      "amiable handsome baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she\r\n",
      "expressed uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really\r\n",
      "delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and\r\n",
      "could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all the\r\n",
      "more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some middle-aged lady as\r\n",
      "guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself dreaded so much the sort of\r\n",
      "superior woman likely to be available for such a position, that he allowed\r\n",
      "himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s objections, and was in this case brave\r\n",
      "enough to defy the world—that is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife,\r\n",
      "and the small group of gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of\r\n",
      "Loamshire. So Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another gentleman\r\n",
      "whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt some venerating\r\n",
      "expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon, noted in the county as a\r\n",
      "man of profound learning, understood for many years to be engaged on a great\r\n",
      "work concerning religious history; also as a man of wealth enough to give\r\n",
      "lustre to his piety, and having views of his own which were to be more clearly\r\n",
      "ascertained on the publication of his book. His very name carried an\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on finishing a plan for some\r\n",
      "buildings (a kind of work which she delighted in), when Celia, who had been\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we looked\r\n",
      "at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six months to-day\r\n",
      "since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at them yet.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full presence of\r\n",
      "the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and principle; two\r\n",
      "associated facts which might show a mysterious electricity if you touched them\r\n",
      "incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s eyes were full of laughter as she\r\n",
      "looked up.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or six\r\n",
      "lunar months?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April when uncle\r\n",
      "gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten them till then. I\r\n",
      "believe you have never thought of them since you locked them up in the cabinet\r\n",
      "here.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a full\r\n",
      "cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil in her hand,\r\n",
      "and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in respect\r\n",
      "to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them. And,” she added,\r\n",
      "after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of mortification, “necklaces are\r\n",
      "quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who was stricter in some things even than\r\n",
      "you are, used to wear ornaments. And Christians generally—surely there are\r\n",
      "women in heaven now who wore jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental\r\n",
      "strength when she really applied herself to argument.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\r\n",
      "discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she had\r\n",
      "caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of course, then,\r\n",
      "let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But the keys, the keys!”\r\n",
      "She pressed her hands against the sides of her head and seemed to despair of\r\n",
      "her memory.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long meditated\r\n",
      "and prearranged.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread out, making\r\n",
      "a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection, but a few of the\r\n",
      "ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest that was obvious at\r\n",
      "first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a\r\n",
      "pearl cross with five brilliants in it. Dorothea immediately took up the\r\n",
      "necklace and fastened it round her sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as\r\n",
      "closely as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of\r\n",
      "Celia’s head and neck, and she could see that it did, in the pier-glass\r\n",
      "opposite.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this cross you\r\n",
      "must wear with your dark dresses.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the cross\r\n",
      "yourself.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\r\n",
      "deprecation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,” said Celia,\r\n",
      "insistingly. “You might wear that.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I would wear\r\n",
      "as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\r\n",
      "complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so fond\r\n",
      "of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need discuss them no\r\n",
      "longer. There—take away your property.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority in this\r\n",
      "Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of an\r\n",
      "unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will never wear\r\n",
      "them?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to keep you\r\n",
      "in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I should feel as\r\n",
      "if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with me, and I should not\r\n",
      "know how to walk.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a little tight\r\n",
      "for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit you better,” she said,\r\n",
      "with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness of the necklace from all points\r\n",
      "of view for Dorothea, made Celia happier in taking it. She was opening some\r\n",
      "ring-boxes, which disclosed a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun\r\n",
      "passing beyond a cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current of\r\n",
      "feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors seem to\r\n",
      "penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why gems are used as\r\n",
      "spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They look like fragments of\r\n",
      "heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful than any of them.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice this at\r\n",
      "first.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her finely\r\n",
      "turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on a level with\r\n",
      "her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify her delight in the\r\n",
      "colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\r\n",
      "beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness, and also\r\n",
      "that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than purple amethysts.\r\n",
      "“You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing else. But see, these agates\r\n",
      "are very pretty and quiet.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then, letting\r\n",
      "her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what miserable men\r\n",
      "find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She paused again, and Celia\r\n",
      "thought that her sister was going to renounce the ornaments, as in consistency\r\n",
      "she ought to do.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all the\r\n",
      "rest away, and the casket.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking at them.\r\n",
      "She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at these little\r\n",
      "fountains of pure color.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with real\r\n",
      "curiosity as to what she would do.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative adornment of\r\n",
      "those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen discernment, which was\r\n",
      "not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke ever attained perfect meekness,\r\n",
      "it would not be for lack of inward fire.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I may\r\n",
      "sink.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her sister, and\r\n",
      "dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the ornaments which she\r\n",
      "put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea too was unhappy, as she went\r\n",
      "on with her plan-drawing, questioning the purity of her own feeling and speech\r\n",
      "in the scene which had ended with that little explosion.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the wrong: it\r\n",
      "was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked that question, and\r\n",
      "she repeated to herself that Dorothea was inconsistent: either she should have\r\n",
      "taken her full share of the jewels, or, after what she had said, she should\r\n",
      "have renounced them altogether.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a necklace\r\n",
      "will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I should be bound by\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society, though of course she herself\r\n",
      "ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is not always consistent.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her sister\r\n",
      "calling her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great architect,\r\n",

      "Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him years ago at\r\n",
      "Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet Wordsworth, you know. Now\r\n",
      "there was something singular. I was at Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and\r\n",
      "I never met him—and I dined with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s.\r\n",
      "There’s an oddity in things, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as\r\n",
      "I may say, Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in\r\n",
      "every sense, you know.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of dinner, the\r\n",
      "party being small and the room still, these motes from the mass of a\r\n",
      "magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man like Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "would support such triviality. His manners, she thought, were very dignified;\r\n",
      "the set of his iron-gray hair and his deep eye-sockets made him resemble the\r\n",
      "portrait of Locke. He had the spare form and the pale complexion which became a\r\n",
      "student; as different as possible from the blooming Englishman of the\r\n",
      "red-whiskered type represented by Sir James Chettam.\r\n",

      "“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\r\n",
      "“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see if\r\n",

      "Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into electrifying\r\n",
      "your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of your cow-house. It\r\n",
      "won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at one time; but I saw it\r\n",
      "would not do. It leads to everything; you can let nothing alone. No, no—see\r\n",
      "that your tenants don’t sell their straw, and that kind of thing; and give them\r\n",
      "draining-tiles, you know. But your fancy farming will not do—the most expensive\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out how men\r\n",

      "horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make yourself poor in\r\n",

      "She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir James\r\n",

      "perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in circles; and that may be\r\n",
      "very well argued; I have argued it myself. The fact is, human reason may carry\r\n",
      "you a little too far—over the hedge, in fact. It carried me a good way at one\r\n",
      "time; but I saw it would not do. I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too\r\n",
      "hard. I have always been in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought;\r\n",
      "else we shall be landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is\r\n",

      "and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such literature just\r\n",
      "now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters lately; the fact is, I\r\n",
      "want a reader for my evenings; but I am fastidious in voices, and I cannot\r\n",
      "endure listening to an imperfect reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I\r\n",
      "feed too much on the inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is\r\n",
      "something like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\r\n",
      "mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and confusing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\r\n",
      "delivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make a\r\n",
      "public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\r\n",
      "occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\r\n",
      "conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy slovenliness.\r\n",
      "Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most interesting man she had\r\n",
      "ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret, the Vaudois clergyman who had\r\n",
      "given conferences on the history of the Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world,\r\n",
      "doubtless with a view to the highest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any\r\n",
      "way present at, to assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating\r\n",
      "thought lifted her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\r\n",

      "“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an\r\n",
      "opportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little into the\r\n",
      "pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a chestnut horse for\r\n",
      "you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw you on Saturday cantering\r\n",
      "over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My groom shall bring Corydon for you\r\n",
      "every day, if you will only mention the time.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not ride any\r\n",

      "that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when she wanted to give it all\r\n",
      "to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that showed\r\n",
      "strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is she not?” he\r\n",
      "continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say something that\r\n",
      "would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as possible above her\r\n",
      "necklace. “She likes giving up.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\r\n",
      "self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to do what\r\n",
      "is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous motive.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered Dorothea,\r\n",
      "reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from high delight or\r\n",
      "anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse Sir James. Why did he\r\n",
      "not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to listen to Mr. Casaubon?—if that\r\n",
      "learned man would only talk, instead of allowing himself to be talked to by Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke, who was just then informing him that the Reformation either meant\r\n",
      "something or it did not, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that\r\n",
      "Catholicism was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a\r\n",
      "Romanist chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\r\n",
      "speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if to\r\n",
      "explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all schools. I knew\r\n",
      "Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went into\r\n",
      "Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the independent bench,\r\n",
      "as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I began a\r\n",
      "long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but when a question\r\n",
      "has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an answer. I have documents\r\n",
      "at my back. But now, how do you arrange your documents?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air of\r\n",
      "effort.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but everything gets\r\n",
      "mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is in A or Z.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said Dorothea. “I\r\n",
      "would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects under each letter.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have an\r\n",
      "excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies meddle\r\n",
      "with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some special\r\n",
      "reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in his mind as\r\n",
      "lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other fragments there,\r\n",
      "and a chance current had sent it alighting on her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He is\r\n",
      "remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep eye-sockets.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "walking away a little.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "de lait.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard you make\r\n",
      "such a comparison before.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good comparison: the\r\n",
      "match is perfect.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.\r\n",

      "“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as if they\r\n",
      "were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul in a man’s\r\n",
      "face.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive malice.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of decision.\r\n",
      "“Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on Biblical Cosmology.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He talks very little,” said Celia\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Celia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I believe\r\n",
      "she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She had never been\r\n",
      "deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest. Sometimes, indeed, she had\r\n",
      "reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a husband happy who had not her way\r\n",
      "of looking at things; and stifled in the depths of her heart was the feeling\r\n",
      "that her sister was too religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were\r\n",
      "like spilt needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even\r\n",
      "eating.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by her, not\r\n",
      "having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why should he? He\r\n",
      "thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and manners must be very marked\r\n",
      "indeed before they cease to be interpreted by preconceptions either confident\r\n",
      "or distrustful. She was thoroughly charming to him, but of course he theorized\r\n",
      "a little about his attachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had\r\n",
      "the rare merit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set\r\n",
      "the smallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\r\n",
      "wife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who could\r\n",
      "help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the property\r\n",
      "qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness alleged against\r\n",
      "Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in, and\r\n",
      "thought that it would die out with marriage. In short, he felt himself to be in\r\n",
      "love in the right place, and was ready to endure a great deal of predominance,\r\n",
      "which, after all, a man could always put down when he liked. Sir James had no\r\n",
      "idea that he should ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome\r\n",
      "girl, in whose cleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of\r\n",
      "it—has always the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\r\n",
      "of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is of a\r\n",
      "sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this estimate; but a kind\r\n",
      "Providence furnishes the limpest personality with a little gum or starch in the\r\n",
      "form of tradition.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse, Miss\r\n",
      "Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is the most\r\n",
      "healthy of exercises.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia good—if\r\n",

      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I ought\r\n",
      "not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond to your\r\n",
      "pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and spoke with cold\r\n",
      "brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy, in amusing contrast with\r\n",
      "the solicitous amiability of her admirer.\r\n",

      "measured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in the\r\n",

      "germinating grain away from the light.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the speaker. Here\r\n",
      "was a man who could understand the higher inward life, and with whom there\r\n",
      "could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could illuminate principle with the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have gone on\r\n",
      "at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions, which has\r\n",
      "facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization. Has any one ever\r\n",
      "pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of pre-matrimonial\r\n",
      "acquaintanceship?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to tell\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had looked\r\n",

      "kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the 2d of October he\r\n",
      "would think it enough to refer to by the mention of that date; judging by the\r\n",

      "on safe opportunities, she had an indirect mode of making her negative wisdom\r\n",
      "tell upon Dorothea, and calling her down from her rhapsodic mood by reminding\r\n",
      "her that people were staring, not listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she\r\n",
      "had to say could wait, and came from her always with the same quiet staccato\r\n",

      "had three more conversations with him, and was convinced that her first\r\n",
      "impressions had been just. He was all she had at first imagined him to be:\r\n",
      "almost everything he had said seemed like a specimen from a mine, or the\r\n",
      "inscription on the door of a museum which might open on the treasures of past\r\n",

      "Dorothea this was adorable genuineness, and religious abstinence from that\r\n",
      "artificiality which uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she looked\r\n",
      "as reverently at Mr. Casaubon’s religious elevation above herself as she did at\r\n",
      "his intellect and learning. He assented to her expressions of devout feeling,\r\n",

      "that here she might reckon on understanding, sympathy, and guidance. On\r\n",
      "one—only one—of her favorite themes she was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "apparently did not care about building cottages, and diverted the talk to the\r\n",
      "extremely narrow accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the\r\n",
      "ancient Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he was gone,\r\n",
      "Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his; and her mind\r\n",
      "was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying conditions of climate\r\n",
      "which modify human needs, and from the admitted wickedness of pagan despots.\r\n",
      "Should she not urge these arguments on Mr. Casaubon when he came again? But\r\n",
      "further reflection told her that she was presumptuous in demanding his\r\n",
      "attention to such a subject; he would not disapprove of her occupying herself\r\n",
      "with it in leisure moments, as other women expected to occupy themselves with\r\n",
      "their dress and embroidery—would not forbid it when—Dorothea felt rather\r\n",
      "ashamed as she detected herself in these speculations. But her uncle had been\r\n",
      "invited to go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to suppose\r\n",

      "oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him disagreeable since\r\n",
      "he showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he had already entered with much\r\n",
      "practical ability into Lovegood’s estimates, and was charmingly docile. She\r\n",
      "proposed to build a couple of cottages, and transfer two families from their\r\n",

      "the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of date in the fact\r\n",

      "as even the preoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not\r\n",

      "affections to which I have but now referred. Our conversations have, I think,\r\n",
      "made sufficiently clear to you the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor\r\n",
      "unsuited, I am aware, to the commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in\r\n",

      "On a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company with her\r\n",
      "uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon’s home was the manor-house. Close by, visible\r\n",
      "from some parts of the garden, was the little church, with the old parsonage\r\n",
      "opposite. In the beginning of his career, Mr. Casaubon had only held the\r\n",
      "living, but the death of his brother had put him in possession of the manor\r\n",
      "also. It had a small park, with a fine old oak here and there, and an avenue of\r\n",
      "limes towards the southwest front, with a sunk fence between park and\r\n",
      "pleasure-ground, so that from the drawing-room windows the glance swept\r\n",
      "uninterruptedly along a slope of greensward till the limes ended in a level of\r\n",
      "corn and pastures, which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting\r\n",
      "sun. This was the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather\r\n",
      "melancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were more\r\n",
      "confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and large clumps of\r\n",
      "trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten yards from the windows.\r\n",
      "The building, of greenish stone, was in the old English style, not ugly, but\r\n",
      "small-windowed and melancholy-looking: the sort of house that must have\r\n",
      "children, many flowers, open windows, and little vistas of bright things, to\r\n",
      "make it seem a joyous home. In this latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant\r\n",
      "of yellow leaves falling slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness\r\n",
      "without sunshine, the house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr.\r\n",

      "“Oh dear!” Celia said to herself, “I am sure Freshitt Hall would have been\r\n",

      "portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling above them like a\r\n",
      "prince issuing from his enchantment in a rose-bush, with a handkerchief swiftly\r\n",
      "metamorphosed from the most delicately odorous petals—Sir James, who talked so\r\n",
      "agreeably, always about things which had common-sense in them, and not about\r\n",
      "learning! Celia had those light young feminine tastes which grave and\r\n",
      "weatherworn gentlemen sometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon’s\r\n",

      "Dorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she could wish:\r\n",
      "the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and curtains with colors\r\n",
      "subdued by time, the curious old maps and bird’s-eye views on the walls of the\r\n",
      "corridor, with here and there an old vase below, had no oppression for her, and\r\n",
      "seemed more cheerful than the casts and pictures at the Grange, which her uncle\r\n",
      "had long ago brought home from his travels—they being probably among the ideas\r\n",
      "he had taken in at one time. To poor Dorothea these severe classical nudities\r\n",
      "and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully inexplicable, staring\r\n",
      "into the midst of her Puritanic conceptions: she had never been taught how she\r\n",
      "could bring them into any sort of relevance with her life. But the owners of\r\n",
      "Lowick apparently had not been travellers, and Mr. Casaubon’s studies of the\r\n",
      "past were not carried on by means of such aids.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion. Everything seemed\r\n",
      "hallowed to her: this was to be the home of her wifehood, and she looked up\r\n",
      "with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he drew her attention\r\n",
      "specially to some actual arrangement and asked her if she would like an\r\n",
      "alteration. All appeals to her taste she met gratefully, but saw nothing to\r\n",
      "alter. His efforts at exact courtesy and formal tenderness had no defect for\r\n",
      "her. She filled up all blanks with unmanifested perfections, interpreting him\r\n",
      "as she interpreted the works of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords\r\n",
      "by her own deafness to the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very kind of you to think of that,” said Dorothea, “but I assure you I\r\n",
      "would rather have all those matters decided for me. I shall be much happier to\r\n",
      "take everything as it is—just as you have been used to have it, or as you will\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon led the way thither. The bow-window looked down the avenue of\r\n",
      "limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were miniatures of\r\n",
      "ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a group. A piece of tapestry\r\n",
      "over a door also showed a blue-green world with a pale stag in it. The chairs\r\n",
      "and tables were thin-legged and easy to upset. It was a room where one might\r\n",
      "fancy the ghost of a tight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her embroidery. A\r\n",
      "light bookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf,\r\n",
      "completing the furniture.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, uncle,” said Dorothea, eagerly. “Pray do not speak of altering anything.\r\n",
      "There are so many other things in the world that want altering—I like to take\r\n",
      "these things as they are. And you like them as they are, don’t you?” she added,\r\n",
      "looking at Mr. Casaubon. “Perhaps this was your mother’s room when she was\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "miniatures. “It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I should think, a\r\n",
      "better portrait. And this one opposite, who is this?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her elder sister. They were, like you and your sister, the only two children\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The sister is pretty,” said Celia, implying that she thought less favorably of\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s mother. It was a new opening to Celia’s imagination, that he\r\n",
      "came of a family who had all been young in their time—the ladies wearing\r\n",
      "necklaces.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a peculiar face,” said Dorothea, looking closely. “Those deep gray eyes\r\n",
      "rather near together—and the delicate irregular nose with a sort of ripple in\r\n",
      "it—and all the powdered curls hanging backward. Altogether it seems to me\r\n",
      "peculiar rather than pretty. There is not even a family likeness between her\r\n",
      "and your mother.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. And they were not alike in their lot.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You did not mention her to me,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My aunt made an unfortunate marriage. I never saw her.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just then to\r\n",
      "ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and she turned to\r\n",
      "the window to admire the view. The sun had lately pierced the gray, and the\r\n",
      "avenue of limes cast shadows.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall we not walk in the garden now?” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you would like to see the church, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “It is a\r\n",
      "droll little church. And the village. It all lies in a nut-shell. By the way,\r\n",
      "it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are like a row of\r\n",
      "alms-houses—little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of thing.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, please,” said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, “I should like to see\r\n",
      "all that.” She had got nothing from him more graphic about the Lowick cottages\r\n",
      "than that they were “not bad.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy borders and\r\n",
      "clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church, Mr. Casaubon said.\r\n",
      "At the little gate leading into the churchyard there was a pause while Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to fetch a key. Celia, who had been\r\n",
      "hanging a little in the rear, came up presently, when she saw that Mr. Casaubon\r\n",
      "was gone away, and said in her easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict\r\n",
      "the suspicion of any malicious intent—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the walks.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that astonishing, Celia?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There may be a young gardener, you know—why not?” said Mr. Brooke. “I told\r\n",
      "Casaubon he should change his gardener.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not a gardener,” said Celia; “a gentleman with a sketch-book. He had\r\n",
      "light-brown curls. I only saw his back. But he was quite young.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The curate’s son, perhaps,” said Mr. Brooke. “Ah, there is Casaubon again, and\r\n",
      "Tucker with him. He is going to introduce Tucker. You don’t know Tucker yet.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the “inferior clergy,” who are\r\n",
      "usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the conversation did\r\n",
      "not lead to any question about his family, and the startling apparition of\r\n",
      "youthfulness was forgotten by every one but Celia. She inwardly declined to\r\n",
      "believe that the light-brown curls and slim figure could have any relationship\r\n",
      "to Mr. Tucker, who was just as old and musty-looking as she would have expected\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s curate to be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven\r\n",
      "(for Celia wished not to be unprincipled), but the corners of his mouth were so\r\n",
      "unpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she should have to\r\n",
      "spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no pretty little\r\n",
      "children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had not been\r\n",
      "without foresight on this head, the curate being able to answer all Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "questions about the villagers and the other parishioners. Everybody, he assured\r\n",
      "her, was well off in Lowick: not a cottager in those double cottages at a low\r\n",
      "rent but kept a pig, and the strips of garden at the back were well tended. The\r\n",
      "small boys wore excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did\r\n",
      "a little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though the\r\n",
      "public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards\r\n",
      "spirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so numerous that\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke observed, “Your farmers leave some barley for the women to glean, I\r\n",
      "see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in their pot, as the good French\r\n",
      "king used to wish for all his people. The French eat a good many fowls—skinny\r\n",
      "fowls, you know.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think it was a very cheap wish of his,” said Dorothea, indignantly. “Are\r\n",
      "kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal virtue?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if he wished them a skinny fowl,” said Celia, “that would not be nice. But\r\n",
      "perhaps he wished them to have fat fowls.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was subauditum; that\r\n",
      "is, present in the king’s mind, but not uttered,” said Mr. Casaubon, smiling\r\n",
      "and bending his head towards Celia, who immediately dropped backward a little,\r\n",
      "because she could not bear Mr. Casaubon to blink at her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She felt some\r\n",
      "disappointment, of which she was yet ashamed, that there was nothing for her to\r\n",
      "do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her mind had glanced over the\r\n",
      "possibility, which she would have preferred, of finding that her home would be\r\n",
      "in a parish which had a larger share of the world’s misery, so that she might\r\n",
      "have had more active duties in it. Then, recurring to the future actually\r\n",
      "before her, she made a picture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon’s aims\r\n",
      "in which she would await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the\r\n",
      "higher knowledge gained by her in that companionship.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not allow him\r\n",
      "to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden through the\r\n",
      "little gate, Mr. Casaubon said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what you have\r\n",
      "seen.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,” answered Dorothea,\r\n",
      "with her usual openness—“almost wishing that the people wanted more to be done\r\n",
      "for them here. I have known so few ways of making my life good for anything. Of\r\n",
      "course, my notions of usefulness must be narrow. I must learn new ways of\r\n",
      "helping people.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doubtless,” said Mr. Casaubon. “Each position has its corresponding duties.\r\n",
      "Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any yearning\r\n",
      "unfulfilled.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, I believe that,” said Dorothea, earnestly. “Do not suppose that I am\r\n",
      "sad.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to the house\r\n",
      "than that by which we came.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a fine\r\n",
      "yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side of the house.\r\n",
      "As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark background of\r\n",
      "evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old tree. Mr. Brooke, who was\r\n",
      "walking in front with Celia, turned his head, and said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is that youngster, Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in fact,” he\r\n",
      "added, looking at Dorothea, “of the lady whose portrait you have been noticing,\r\n",
      "my aunt Julia.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man had laid down his sketch-book and risen. His bushy light-brown\r\n",
      "curls, as well as his youthfulness, identified him at once with Celia’s\r\n",
      "apparition.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this is Miss\r\n",
      "Brooke.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cousin was so close now, that, when he lifted his hat, Dorothea could see a\r\n",
      "pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate irregular nose with a little\r\n",
      "ripple in it, and hair falling backward; but there was a mouth and chin of a\r\n",
      "more prominent, threatening aspect than belonged to the type of the\r\n",
      "grandmother’s miniature. Young Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as\r\n",
      "if he were charmed with this introduction to his future second cousin and her\r\n",
      "relatives; but wore rather a pouting air of discontent.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are an artist, I see,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book and\r\n",

      "detestable. There was too much cleverness in her apology: she was laughing both\r\n",

      "did not approve of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on\r\n",

      "introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke, whose youthful\r\n",

      "was more inclined to general good-fellowship than to taking sides, but there\r\n",
      "was no need for him to be hasty in making any new man acquaintance. Rosamond\r\n",

      "for him in another. And I have no ill-will towards Mary Garth, but there’s\r\n",
      "justice to be thought of. And Mr. Featherstone’s first wife brought him no\r\n",
      "money, as my sister did. Her nieces and nephews can’t have so much claim as my\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts that entered into her\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "looking at her, and their eyes met with that peculiar meeting which is never\r\n",
      "arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden divine clearance of haze. I think\r\n",
      "Lydgate turned a little paler than usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt\r\n",
      "a certain astonishment. After that, she was really anxious to go, and did not\r\n",

      "hands with him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet this result, which she took to be a mutual impression, called falling in\r\n",
      "love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand. Ever since that\r\n",
      "important new arrival in Middlemarch she had woven a little future, of which\r\n",
      "something like this scene was the necessary beginning. Strangers, whether\r\n",
      "wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly escorted and accompanied by\r\n",
      "portmanteaus, have always had a circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind,\r\n",
      "against which native merit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was\r\n",
      "absolutely necessary to Rosamond’s social romance, which had always turned on a\r\n",
      "lover and bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no connections at\r\n",
      "all like her own: of late, indeed, the construction seemed to demand that he\r\n",
      "should somehow be related to a baronet. Now that she and the stranger had met,\r\n",
      "reality proved much more moving than anticipation, and Rosamond could not doubt\r\n",
      "that this was the great epoch of her life. She judged of her own symptoms as\r\n",
      "those of awakening love, and she held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate\r\n",
      "should have fallen in love at first sight of her. These things happened so\r\n",
      "often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the complexion showed\r\n",
      "all the better for it? Rosamond, though no older than Mary, was rather used to\r\n",
      "being fallen in love with; but she, for her part, had remained indifferent and\r\n",
      "fastidiously critical towards both fresh sprig and faded bachelor. And here was\r\n",
      "Mr. Lydgate suddenly corresponding to her ideal, being altogether foreign to\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, carrying a certain air of distinction congruous with good family,\r\n",
      "and possessing connections which offered vistas of that middle-class heaven,\r\n",
      "rank; a man of talent, also, whom it would be especially delightful to enslave:\r\n",
      "in fact, a man who had touched her nature quite newly, and brought a vivid\r\n",
      "interest into her life which was better than any fancied “might-be” such as she\r\n",
      "was in the habit of opposing to the actual.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied and\r\n",
      "inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her structure had the usual\r\n",
      "airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic imagination when the\r\n",
      "foundation had been once presupposed; and before they had ridden a mile she was\r\n",
      "far on in the costume and introductions of her wedded life, having determined\r\n",
      "on her house in Middlemarch, and foreseen the visits she would pay to her\r\n",
      "husband’s high-bred relatives at a distance, whose finished manners she could\r\n",
      "appropriate as thoroughly as she had done her school accomplishments, preparing\r\n",
      "herself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There was\r\n",
      "nothing financial, still less sordid, in her previsions: she cared about what\r\n",

      "Fred’s mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his ready\r\n",
      "hopefulness could not immediately quell. He saw no way of eluding\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s stupid demand without incurring consequences which he liked less\r\n",
      "even than the task of fulfilling it. His father was already out of humor with\r\n",
      "him, and would be still more so if he were the occasion of any additional\r\n",
      "coolness between his own family and the Bulstrodes. Then, he himself hated\r\n",
      "having to go and speak to his uncle Bulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine\r\n",
      "he had said many foolish things about Featherstone’s property, and these had\r\n",
      "been magnified by report. Fred felt that he made a wretched figure as a fellow\r\n",
      "who bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like Featherstone, and\r\n",
      "went to beg for certificates at his bidding. But—those expectations! He really\r\n",
      "had them, and he saw no agreeable alternative if he gave them up; besides, he\r\n",
      "had lately made a debt which galled him extremely, and old Featherstone had\r\n",
      "almost bargained to pay it off. The whole affair was miserably small: his debts\r\n",
      "were small, even his expectations were not anything so very magnificent. Fred\r\n",
      "had known men to whom he would have been ashamed of confessing the smallness of\r\n",
      "his scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak of misanthropic\r\n",
      "bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable\r\n",
      "heir to nothing in particular, while such men as Mainwaring and Vyan—certainly\r\n",
      "life was a poor business, when a spirited young fellow, with a good appetite\r\n",

      "exercise his power by tormenting him a little, and also probably to get some\r\n",
      "satisfaction out of seeing him on unpleasant terms with Bulstrode. Fred fancied\r\n",

      "with Mr. Bulstrode in his private room at the Bank at half-past one, when he\r\n",
      "was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had come in at one o’clock,\r\n",
      "and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him, that there was little chance of\r\n",
      "the interview being over in half an hour. The banker’s speech was fluent, but\r\n",
      "it was also copious, and he used up an appreciable amount of time in brief\r\n",
      "meditative pauses. Do not imagine his sickly aspect to have been of the yellow,\r\n",
      "black-haired sort: he had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,\r\n",
      "light-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his subdued tone an\r\n",
      "undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with openness; though\r\n",
      "there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not be given to concealment\r\n",
      "of anything except his own voice, unless it can be shown that Holy Writ has\r\n",
      "placed the seat of candor in the lungs. Mr. Bulstrode had also a deferential\r\n",
      "bending attitude in listening, and an apparently fixed attentiveness in his\r\n",
      "eyes which made those persons who thought themselves worth hearing infer that\r\n",
      "he was seeking the utmost improvement from their discourse. Others, who\r\n",
      "expected to make no great figure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on\r\n",
      "them. If you are not proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction\r\n",
      "in seeing your guest hold up his wine-glass to the light and look judicial.\r\n",
      "Such joys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr. Bulstrode’s close\r\n",
      "attention was not agreeable to the publicans and sinners in Middlemarch; it was\r\n",
      "attributed by some to his being a Pharisee, and by others to his being\r\n",
      "Evangelical. Less superficial reasoners among them wished to know who his\r\n",
      "father and grandfather were, observing that five-and-twenty years ago nobody\r\n",
      "had ever heard of a Bulstrode in Middlemarch. To his present visitor, Lydgate,\r\n",
      "the scrutinizing look was a matter of indifference: he simply formed an\r\n",
      "unfavorable opinion of the banker’s constitution, and concluded that he had an\r\n",
      "eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible things.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here occasionally,\r\n",

      "I have the privilege of finding you a valuable coadjutor in the interesting\r\n",
      "matter of hospital management, there will be many questions which we shall need\r\n",
      "to discuss in private. As to the new hospital, which is nearly finished, I\r\n",
      "shall consider what you have said about the advantages of the special\r\n",
      "destination for fevers. The decision will rest with me, for though Lord\r\n",

      "the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we get our medical reforms; and\r\n",
      "what would do more for medical education than the spread of such schools over\r\n",
      "the country? A born provincial man who has a grain of public spirit as well as\r\n",
      "a few ideas, should do what he can to resist the rush of everything that is a\r\n",
      "little better than common towards London. Any valid professional aims may often\r\n",

      "becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his ordinary bearing\r\n",
      "there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of success, a confidence in\r\n",
      "his own powers and integrity much fortified by contempt for petty obstacles or\r\n",
      "seductions of which he had had no experience. But this proud openness was made\r\n",
      "lovable by an expression of unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked\r\n",
      "him the better for the difference between them in pitch and manners; he\r\n",
      "certainly liked him the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in\r\n",

      "complexion of his prejudices, which, in spite of noble intention and sympathy,\r\n",
      "were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world: that\r\n",
      "distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor, did not penetrate\r\n",
      "his feeling and judgment about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its\r\n",
      "being known (without his telling) that he was better born than other country\r\n",
      "surgeons. He did not mean to think of furniture at present; but whenever he did\r\n",
      "so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift\r\n",
      "him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in\r\n",

      "As to women, he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly, which\r\n",
      "he meant to be final, since marriage at some distant period would of course not\r\n",
      "be impetuous. For those who want to be acquainted with Lydgate it will be good\r\n",
      "to know what was that case of impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example\r\n",
      "of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone, together with the\r\n",
      "chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable. The story can be\r\n",
      "told without many words. It happened when he was studying in Paris, and just at\r\n",
      "the time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some\r\n",
      "galvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his experimenting, and not being\r\n",
      "able to elicit the facts he needed, he left his frogs and rabbits to some\r\n",
      "repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks,\r\n",
      "and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin, where\r\n",
      "there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times; attracted, not\r\n",
      "by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors, but by an actress whose\r\n",
      "part it was to stab her lover, mistaking him for the evil-designing duke of the\r\n",
      "piece. Lydgate was in love with this actress, as a man is in love with a woman\r\n",
      "whom he never expects to speak to. She was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a\r\n",
      "Greek profile, and rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty which\r\n",
      "carries a sweet matronliness even in youth, and her voice was a soft cooing.\r\n",
      "She had but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous reputation, her husband\r\n",
      "acting with her as the unfortunate lover. It was her acting which was “no\r\n",
      "better than it should be,” but the public was satisfied. Lydgate’s only\r\n",
      "relaxation now was to go and look at this woman, just as he might have thrown\r\n",
      "himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while,\r\n",
      "without prejudice to his galvanism, to which he would presently return. But\r\n",
      "this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe. At the moment when the\r\n",
      "heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover, and he was to fall gracefully,\r\n",
      "the wife veritably stabbed her husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek\r\n",
      "pierced the house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a swoon were\r\n",
      "demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this time. Lydgate leaped\r\n",
      "and climbed, he hardly knew how, on to the stage, and was active in help,\r\n",
      "making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and\r\n",
      "lifting her gently in his arms. Paris rang with the story of this death:—was it\r\n",
      "a murder? Some of the actress’s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in\r\n",
      "her guilt, and liked her the better for it (such was the taste of those times);\r\n",
      "but Lydgate was not one of these. He vehemently contended for her innocence,\r\n",
      "and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before, had\r\n",
      "passed now into personal devotion, and tender thought of her lot. The notion of\r\n",
      "murder was absurd: no motive was discoverable, the young couple being\r\n",
      "understood to dote on each other; and it was not unprecedented that an\r\n",
      "accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences. The\r\n",
      "legal investigation ended in Madame Laure’s release. Lydgate by this time had\r\n",
      "had many interviews with her, and found her more and more adorable. She talked\r\n",
      "little; but that was an additional charm. She was melancholy, and seemed\r\n",
      "grateful; her presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was\r\n",
      "madly anxious about her affection, and jealous lest any other man than himself\r\n",
      "should win it and ask her to marry him. But instead of reopening her engagement\r\n",
      "at the Porte Saint Martin, where she would have been all the more popular for\r\n",
      "the fatal episode, she left Paris without warning, forsaking her little court\r\n",
      "of admirers. Perhaps no one carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that\r\n",
      "all science had come to a stand-still while he imagined the unhappy Laure,\r\n",
      "stricken by ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful\r\n",
      "comforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as some\r\n",
      "other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered indications\r\n",
      "that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He found her at last acting with great\r\n",
      "success at Avignon under the same name, looking more majestic than ever as a\r\n",
      "forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms. He spoke to her after the play,\r\n",
      "was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear\r\n",
      "depths of water, and obtained leave to visit her the next day; when he was bent\r\n",
      "on telling her that he adored her, and on asking her to marry him. He knew that\r\n",
      "this was like the sudden impulse of a madman—incongruous even with his habitual\r\n",
      "foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he was resolved to do. He had\r\n",
      "two selves within him apparently, and they must learn to accommodate each other\r\n",
      "and bear reciprocal impediments. Strange, that some of us, with quick alternate\r\n",
      "vision, see beyond our infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights,\r\n",
      "behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have come all the way from Paris to find me?” she said to him the next\r\n",

      "second place; and though, when her turn came, he dwelt on the image of her for\r\n",
      "the rest of his walk, he felt no agitation, and had no sense that any new\r\n",

      "for several years; and therefore he was not ready to entertain the notion of\r\n",
      "being in love with a girl whom he happened to admire. He did admire Rosamond\r\n",
      "exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him about Laure was not, he\r\n",
      "thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman. Certainly, if falling\r\n",

      "the delicacies of life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a\r\n",
      "force of demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt\r\n",
      "sure that if ever he married, his wife would have that feminine radiance, that\r\n",
      "distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers and music, that sort\r\n",

      "anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the specific differences of\r\n",
      "typhus and typhoid. He went home and read far into the smallest hour, bringing\r\n",

      "in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match the church which\r\n",
      "it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the house was old, but with\r\n",
      "another grade of age—that of Mr. Farebrother’s father and grandfather. There\r\n",
      "were painted white chairs, with gilding and wreaths on them, and some lingering\r\n",
      "red silk damask with slits in it. There were engraved portraits of Lord\r\n",

      "dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed, and still under seventy; Miss Noble,\r\n",

      "Mr. Farebrother was a bachelor, he had thought of being ushered into a snuggery\r\n",
      "where the chief furniture would probably be books and collections of natural\r\n",
      "objects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear rather a changed aspect, as most men\r\n",
      "do when acquaintances made elsewhere see them for the first time in their own\r\n",
      "homes; some indeed showing like an actor of genial parts disadvantageously cast\r\n",
      "for the curmudgeon in a new piece. This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother:\r\n",
      "he seemed a trifle milder and more silent, the chief talker being his mother,\r\n",

      "to regard no subject as quite safe without her steering. She was afforded\r\n",
      "leisure for this function by having all her little wants attended to by Miss\r\n",

      "from those who had much that she might give to those who had nothing, and\r\n",

      "more just than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his ancestors\r\n",
      "ought to have been hanged instead of him. If those who had bad fathers and\r\n",

      "There was nothing but pickled vermin, and drawers full of blue-bottles and\r\n",
      "moths, with no carpet on the floor. Mr. Lydgate must excuse it. A game at\r\n",
      "cribbage would be far better. In short, it was plain that a vicar might be\r\n",
      "adored by his womankind as the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by\r\n",
      "them to stand in much need of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its implied\r\n",

      "neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the bookcase filled with expensive\r\n",
      "illustrated books on Natural History, made him think again of the winnings at\r\n",
      "cards and their destination. But he was beginning to wish that the very best\r\n",
      "construction of everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The\r\n",
      "Vicar’s frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an uneasy\r\n",
      "consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but simply the\r\n",
      "relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as possible. Apparently he was\r\n",
      "not without a sense that his freedom of speech might seem premature, for he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate, and\r\n",

      "apartment at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his, and he told me\r\n",
      "a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you first came that you were\r\n",

      "strictness of persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve their\r\n",
      "domestic manners, and whose lofty aims were not needed to account for their\r\n",
      "actions. Then, his preaching was ingenious and pithy, like the preaching of the\r\n",
      "English Church in its robust age, and his sermons were delivered without book.\r\n",
      "People outside his parish went to hear him; and, since to fill the church was\r\n",
      "always the most difficult part of a clergyman’s function, here was another\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this feeling uppermost, he continued to waive the question of the\r\n",
      "chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper business of\r\n",
      "his, but likely enough never to vex him with a demand for his vote. Lydgate, at\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s request, was laying down plans for the internal arrangements of\r\n",
      "the new hospital, and the two were often in consultation. The banker was always\r\n",
      "presupposing that he could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made\r\n",
      "no special recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When\r\n",
      "the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had notice\r\n",
      "that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of the directors\r\n",
      "and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he had a vexed sense that he\r\n",
      "must make up his mind on this trivial Middlemarch business. He could not help\r\n",
      "hearing within him the distinct declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister,\r\n",
      "and that the Tyke affair was a question of office or no office; and he could\r\n",
      "not help an equally pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For\r\n",
      "his observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother’s assurance that the\r\n",
      "banker would not overlook opposition. “Confound their petty politics!” was one\r\n",
      "of his thoughts for three mornings in the meditative process of shaving, when\r\n",
      "he had begun to feel that he must really hold a court of conscience on this\r\n",
      "matter. Certainly there were valid things to be said against the election of\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother: he had too much on his hands already, especially considering\r\n",
      "how much time he spent on non-clerical occupations. Then again it was a\r\n",
      "continually repeated shock, disturbing Lydgate’s esteem, that the Vicar should\r\n",
      "obviously play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but evidently\r\n",
      "liking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended on theory for the\r\n",
      "desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen’s wit was stagnant for want\r\n",
      "of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he would have played very much less but\r\n",
      "for the money. There was a billiard-room at the Green Dragon, which some\r\n",
      "anxious mothers and wives regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch. The\r\n",
      "Vicar was a first-rate billiard-player, and though he did not frequent the\r\n",
      "Green Dragon, there were reports that he had sometimes been there in the\r\n",
      "daytime and had won money. And as to the chaplaincy, he did not pretend that he\r\n",
      "cared for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds. Lydgate was no Puritan,\r\n",
      "but he did not care for play, and winning money at it had always seemed a\r\n",
      "meanness to him; besides, he had an ideal of life which made this subservience\r\n",
      "of conduct to the gaining of small sums thoroughly hateful to him. Hitherto in\r\n",
      "his own life his wants had been supplied without any trouble to himself, and\r\n",
      "his first impulse was always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no\r\n",
      "importance to a gentleman; it had never occurred to him to devise a plan for\r\n",
      "getting half-crowns. He had always known in a general way that he was not rich,\r\n",
      "but he had never felt poor, and he had no power of imagining the part which the\r\n",
      "want of money plays in determining the actions of men. Money had never been a\r\n",
      "motive to him. Hence he was not ready to frame excuses for this deliberate\r\n",
      "pursuit of small gains. It was altogether repulsive to him, and he never\r\n",
      "entered into any calculation of the ratio between the Vicar’s income and his\r\n",
      "more or less necessary expenditure. It was possible that he would not have made\r\n",
      "such a calculation in his own case.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told more\r\n",
      "strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before. One would know much\r\n",
      "better what to do if men’s characters were more consistent, and especially if\r\n",
      "one’s friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake!\r\n",
      "Lydgate was convinced that if there had been no valid objection to Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother, he would have voted for him, whatever Bulstrode might have felt on\r\n",
      "the subject: he did not intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode’s. On the other\r\n",
      "hand, there was Tyke, a man entirely given to his clerical office, who was\r\n",
      "simply curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter’s parish, and had time for extra\r\n",
      "duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that they could not\r\n",
      "bear him, and suspected him of cant. Really, from his point of view, Bulstrode\r\n",
      "was thoroughly justified.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make him\r\n",
      "wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being obliged to\r\n",
      "wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by getting on bad\r\n",
      "terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against Farebrother, and helping\r\n",
      "to deprive him of function and salary; and the question occurred whether the\r\n",
      "additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that ignoble care\r\n",
      "about winning at cards. Moreover, Lydgate did not like the consciousness that\r\n",
      "in voting for Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for\r\n",
      "himself. But would the end really be his own convenience? Other people would\r\n",
      "say so, and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake\r\n",
      "of making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He for his\r\n",
      "own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been concerned, he\r\n",
      "would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker’s friendship or enmity. What\r\n",
      "he really cared for was a medium for his work, a vehicle for his ideas; and\r\n",
      "after all, was he not bound to prefer the object of getting a good hospital,\r\n",
      "where he could demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test\r\n",
      "therapeutic results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For\r\n",
      "the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small\r\n",
      "social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end of his inward\r\n",
      "debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was really in the chance\r\n",
      "that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to the question, and make the\r\n",
      "scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for voting. I think he trusted a\r\n",
      "little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances—some feeling\r\n",
      "rushing warmly and making resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only\r\n",
      "made it more difficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on\r\n",
      "which side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting the\r\n",
      "subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed beforehand like\r\n",
      "a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his unmixed resolutions of\r\n",
      "independence and his select purposes, would find himself at the very outset in\r\n",
      "the grasp of petty alternatives, each of which was repugnant to him. In his\r\n",
      "student’s chambers, he had prearranged his social action quite differently.\r\n",

      "having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this deficiency in him as\r\n",
      "if he had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is probable that his professional\r\n",

      "superfluously tall; his trousers got creased at the knees, and showed an excess\r\n",
      "of boot at a time when straps seemed necessary to any dignity of bearing; you\r\n",
      "heard him go in and out, and up and down, as if he had come to see after the\r\n",

      "disease and throw it; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it\r\n",

      "was desirable that chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a\r\n",

      "suspicious of electioneering intentions. “You don’t seem to know that one of\r\n",

      "who is about to give his vote has not been fully informed, I can now\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,” said Mr. Bulstrode,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate: will you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“The thing is settled now,” said Mr. Wrench, rising. “We all know how Mr.\r\n",
      "Lydgate will vote.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,” said Lydgate, rather\r\n",
      "defiantly, and keeping his pencil suspended.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do you regard\r\n",
      "that meaning as offensive?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting with him on\r\n",
      "that account.” Lydgate immediately wrote down “Tyke.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate continued\r\n",
      "to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He was really uncertain whether Tyke were not the\r\n",
      "more suitable candidate, and yet his consciousness told him that if he had been\r\n",
      "quite free from indirect bias he should have voted for Mr. Farebrother. The\r\n",
      "affair of the chaplaincy remained a sore point in his memory as a case in which\r\n",
      "this petty medium of Middlemarch had been too strong for him. How could a man\r\n",
      "be satisfied with a decision between such alternatives and under such\r\n",
      "circumstances? No more than he can be satisfied with his hat, which he has\r\n",
      "chosen from among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him, wearing it\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The character\r\n",
      "of the publican and sinner is not always practically incompatible with that of\r\n",
      "the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the\r\n",
      "faultiness of our own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments, or the\r\n",
      "dulness of our own jokes. But the Vicar of St. Botolph’s had certainly escaped\r\n",
      "the slightest tincture of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself\r\n",
      "that he was too much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in\r\n",
      "this—that he could excuse others for thinking slightly of him, and could judge\r\n",

      "choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes it easy work for the\r\n",
      "hero, as if the first resolves were enough. Another story says that he came to\r\n",

      "pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is something violent and\r\n",
      "strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am seeing so much all at once, and\r\n",

      "if you have a genius for painting, would it not be right to take that as a\r\n",

      "bring a new complaint in the moment of her penitent acknowledgment, partly\r\n",
      "because he wanted to avoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly\r\n",
      "because he was too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not\r\n",
      "so exhausted on his scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in other\r\n",
      "directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little fire: it is\r\n",

      "The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English polities,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is too\r\n",

      "that. Putting it aside for a moment, he looked round vaguely, as if seeking\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and occupied\r\n",

      "time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear from his expressing a\r\n",

      "that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect if another sitting\r\n",
      "could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the morrow Santa Clara too was\r\n",
      "retouched more than once. The result of all was so far from displeasing to Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, that he arranged for the purchase of the picture in which Saint\r\n",
      "Thomas Aquinas sat among the doctors of the Church in a disputation too\r\n",
      "abstract to be represented, but listened to with more or less attention by an\r\n",
      "audience above. The Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place,\r\n",
      "Naumann declared himself to be dissatisfied with—he could not, in conscience,\r\n",

      "evening, or on his dithyrambs about Dorothea’s charm, in all which Will joined,\r\n",
      "but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any detail of Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "beauty, than Will got exasperated at his presumption: there was grossness in\r\n",
      "his choice of the most ordinary words, and what business had he to talk of her\r\n",
      "lips? She was not a woman to be spoken of as other women were. Will could not\r\n",
      "say just what he thought, but he became irritable. And yet, when after some\r\n",
      "resistance he had consented to take the Casaubons to his friend’s studio, he\r\n",
      "had been allured by the gratification of his pride in being the person who\r\n",

      "her divineness, for the ordinary phrases which might apply to mere bodily\r\n",
      "prettiness were not applicable to her. (Certainly all Tipton and its\r\n",
      "neighborhood, as well as Dorothea herself, would have been surprised at her\r\n",

      "wanted to be something more special in her remembrance than he could yet\r\n",
      "believe himself likely to be. He was rather impatient under that open ardent\r\n",
      "good-will, which he saw was her usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a\r\n",
      "woman throned out of their reach plays a great part in men’s lives, but in most\r\n",
      "cases the worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by\r\n",
      "which his soul’s sovereign may cheer him without descending from her high\r\n",
      "place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were plenty of\r\n",
      "contradictions in his imaginative demands. It was beautiful to see how\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to Mr. Casaubon: she\r\n",
      "would have lost some of her halo if she had been without that duteous\r\n",
      "preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the husband’s sandy absorption of\r\n",
      "such nectar was too intolerable; and Will’s longing to say damaging things\r\n",
      "about him was perhaps not the less tormenting because he felt the strongest\r\n",
      "reasons for restraining it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he persuaded himself that\r\n",

      "might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he entered she was looking at some\r\n",
      "cameos which she had been buying for Celia. She greeted Will as if his visit\r\n",
      "were quite a matter of course, and said at once, having a cameo bracelet in her\r\n",
      "hand—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos, and can\r\n",
      "tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us in choosing\r\n",
      "them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he thought there was not time. He will finish\r\n",
      "his work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three days. I have been uneasy\r\n",
      "about these cameos. Pray sit down and look at them.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about these\r\n",
      "little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is fine: it will\r\n",
      "just suit you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You saw her\r\n",
      "with me at Lowick: she is light-haired and very pretty—at least I think so. We\r\n",
      "were never so long away from each other in our lives before. She is a great pet\r\n",
      "and never was naughty in her life. I found out before I came away that she\r\n",
      "wanted me to buy her some cameos, and I should be sorry for them not to be\r\n",
      "good—after their kind.” Dorothea added the last words with a smile.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem not to care about cameos,” said Will, seating himself at some\r\n",
      "distance from her, and observing her while she closed the cases.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, frankly, I don’t think them a great object in life,” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose I am dull about many things,” said Dorothea, simply. “I should like\r\n",
      "to make life beautiful—I mean everybody’s life. And then all this immense\r\n",
      "expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life and make it no better\r\n",
      "for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment of anything when I am made to\r\n",
      "think that most people are shut out from it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,” said Will, impetuously. “You might\r\n",
      "say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you carried it out\r\n",
      "you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn evil that you might\r\n",
      "have no advantage over others. The best piety is to enjoy—when you can. You are\r\n",
      "doing the most then to save the earth’s character as an agreeable planet. And\r\n",
      "enjoyment radiates. It is of no use to try and take care of all the world; that\r\n",
      "is being taken care of when you feel delight—in art or in anything else. Would\r\n",
      "you turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and\r\n",
      "moralizing over misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in the\r\n",
      "virtues of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.” Will had gone\r\n",
      "further than he intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea’s thought was not\r\n",
      "taking just the same direction as his own, and she answered without any special\r\n",
      "emotion—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am never unhappy\r\n",
      "long together. I am angry and naughty—not like Celia: I have a great outburst,\r\n",
      "and then all seems glorious again. I cannot help believing in glorious things\r\n",
      "in a blind sort of way. I should be quite willing to enjoy the art here, but\r\n",
      "there is so much that I don’t know the reason of—so much that seems to me a\r\n",
      "consecration of ugliness rather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be\r\n",
      "wonderful, but the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even\r\n",
      "ridiculous. Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble—something that\r\n",
      "I might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian Hill;\r\n",
      "but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the best kind\r\n",
      "among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that soil to grow in.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current of her\r\n",
      "anxiety; “I see it must be very difficult to do anything good. I have often\r\n",
      "felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives would look much uglier\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea parted her lips again as if she were going to say more, but changed\r\n",
      "her mind and paused.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are too young—it is an anachronism for you to have such thoughts,” said\r\n",
      "Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head habitual to him. “You talk\r\n",
      "as if you had never known any youth. It is monstrous—as if you had had a vision\r\n",
      "of Hades in your childhood, like the boy in the legend. You have been brought\r\n",
      "up in some of those horrible notions that choose the sweetest women to\r\n",
      "devour—like Minotaurs. And now you will go and be shut up in that stone prison\r\n",
      "at Lowick: you will be buried alive. It makes me savage to think of it! I would\r\n",
      "rather never have seen you than think of you with such a prospect.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will again feared that he had gone too far; but the meaning we attach to words\r\n",
      "depends on our feeling, and his tone of angry regret had so much kindness in it\r\n",
      "for Dorothea’s heart, which had always been giving out ardor and had never been\r\n",
      "fed with much from the living beings around her, that she felt a new sense of\r\n",
      "gratitude and answered with a gentle smile—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did not like\r\n",

      "my chosen home.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will did not\r\n",
      "know what to say, since it would not be useful for him to embrace her slippers,\r\n",
      "and tell her that he would die for her: it was clear that she required nothing\r\n",
      "of the sort; and they were both silent for a moment or two, when Dorothea began\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was it?” said Will, observing that she spoke with a timidity quite new in\r\n",

      "seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon’s learning he must have before him the same\r\n",
      "materials as German scholars—has he not?” Dorothea’s timidity was due to an\r\n",
      "indistinct consciousness that she was in the strange situation of consulting a\r\n",
      "third person about the adequacy of Mr. Casaubon’s learning.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon’s not be valuable, like theirs?” said\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That depends on the line of study taken,” said Will, also getting a tone of\r\n",
      "rejoinder. “The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing as chemistry:\r\n",
      "new discoveries are constantly making new points of view. Who wants a system on\r\n",
      "the basis of the four elements, or a book to refute Paracelsus? Do you not see\r\n",
      "that it is no use now to be crawling a little way after men of the last\r\n",
      "century—men like Bryant—and correcting their mistakes?—living in a lumber-room\r\n",

      "ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you more painfully, if\r\n",
      "you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so much goodness, power, and\r\n",
      "learning, should in any way fail in what has been the labor of his best years.”\r\n",
      "She was beginning to be shocked that she had got to such a point of\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am wrong altogether.\r\n",
      "Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving\r\n",

      "failure. Mr. Casaubon’s generosity has perhaps been dangerous to me, and I mean\r\n",
      "to renounce the liberty it has given me. I mean to go back to England shortly\r\n",

      "which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in bringing with him his\r\n",

      "enable him to make money was exhilarating enough to lead him over the same\r\n",
      "ground again the first thing in the morning. He felt sure that if he did not\r\n",
      "come to a bargain with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of\r\n",
      "circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening his acuteness and endowing him with\r\n",

      "way that he never would have done (the horse being a friend’s) if he had not\r\n",

      "of this sort, you must know how to draw your inferences, and not be a spoon who\r\n",
      "takes things literally. The color of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred\r\n",
      "happened to know that Lord Medlicote’s man was on the look-out for just such a\r\n",
      "horse. After all his running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the\r\n",
      "evening, when the farmer was absent, that he had seen worse horses go for\r\n",
      "eighty pounds. Of course he contradicted himself twenty times over, but when\r\n",
      "you know what is likely to be true you can test a man’s admissions. And Fred\r\n",
      "could not but reckon his own judgment of a horse as worth something. The farmer\r\n",
      "had paused over Fred’s respectable though broken-winded steed long enough to\r\n",

      "Diamond. In that case Fred, when he had parted with his new horse for at least\r\n",
      "eighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction, and\r\n",
      "would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the bill; so that\r\n",
      "the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the utmost be twenty-five\r\n",
      "pounds. By the time he was hurrying on his clothes in the morning, he saw so\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "what words she should use to cut him the most effectively. Like the eccentric\r\n",
      "woman she was, she was at present absorbed in considering what was to be done,\r\n",
      "and did not fancy that the end could be better achieved by bitter remarks or\r\n",
      "explosions. But she had made Fred feel for the first time something like the\r\n",
      "tooth of remorse. Curiously enough, his pain in the affair beforehand had\r\n",
      "consisted almost entirely in the sense that he must seem dishonorable, and sink\r\n",
      "in the opinion of the Garths: he had not occupied himself with the\r\n",
      "inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion them, for this\r\n",
      "exercise of the imagination on other people’s needs is not common with hopeful\r\n",
      "young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought up in the notion that the\r\n",
      "highest motive for not doing a wrong is something irrespective of the beings\r\n",
      "who would suffer the wrong. But at this moment he suddenly saw himself as a\r\n",

      "all round and tried all honest means?” he added, fixing his merciful gray eyes\r\n",

      "sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid away thirty with my old\r\n",
      "horse in order to get another which I was going to sell for eighty or more—I\r\n",
      "meant to go without a horse—but now it has turned out vicious and lamed itself.\r\n",

      "of the workmen, the roar of the furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine,\r\n",

      "himself by putting his thumbs in his armholes. “To let fever get unawares into\r\n",

      "further attendance in the case. The house might be a good one, but Mr. Wrench\r\n",
      "was not going to truckle to anybody on a professional matter. He reflected,\r\n",
      "with much probability on his side, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught\r\n",
      "tripping too, and that his ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of\r\n",
      "drugs by his professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He threw\r\n",
      "out biting remarks on Lydgate’s tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get himself\r\n",

      "puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but perilous, and not more\r\n",
      "enviable than the reputation of the weather-prophet. He was impatient of the\r\n",
      "foolish expectations amidst which all work must be carried on, and likely\r\n",

      "never thought of staying long with her, yet it seemed that the brief impersonal\r\n",
      "conversations they had together were creating that peculiar intimacy which\r\n",
      "consists in shyness. They were obliged to look at each other in speaking, and\r\n",
      "somehow the looking could not be carried through as the matter of course which\r\n",
      "it really was. Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and\r\n",
      "one day looked down, or anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this turned\r\n",
      "out badly: the next day, Rosamond looked down, and the consequence was that\r\n",
      "when their eyes met again, both were more conscious than before. There was no\r\n",
      "help for this in science, and as Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed to\r\n",
      "be no help for it in folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors no longer\r\n",

      "device, and behavior can hardly become easy unless it frankly recognizes a\r\n",
      "mutual fascination—which of course need not mean anything deep or serious. This\r\n",
      "was the way in which Rosamond and Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made\r\n",
      "their intercourse lively again. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once\r\n",
      "more music in the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy’s\r\n",
      "mayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he could, took his seat by Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "side, and lingered to hear her music, calling himself her captive—meaning, all\r\n",
      "the while, not to be her captive. The preposterousness of the notion that he\r\n",
      "could at once set up a satisfactory establishment as a married man was a\r\n",
      "sufficient guarantee against danger. This play at being a little in love was\r\n",
      "agreeable, and did not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all,\r\n",
      "was not necessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her part, had never\r\n",
      "enjoyed the days so much in her life before: she was sure of being admired by\r\n",
      "some one worth captivating, and she did not distinguish flirtation from love,\r\n",
      "either in herself or in another. She seemed to be sailing with a fair wind just\r\n",
      "whither she would go, and her thoughts were much occupied with a handsome house\r\n",
      "in Lowick Gate which she hoped would by-and-by be vacant. She was quite\r\n",
      "determined, when she was married, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors\r\n",
      "who were not agreeable to her at her father’s; and she imagined the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Certainly her thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he seemed to\r\n",
      "her almost perfect: if he had known his notes so that his enchantment under her\r\n",
      "music had been less like an emotional elephant’s, and if he had been able to\r\n",
      "discriminate better the refinements of her taste in dress, she could hardly\r\n",
      "have mentioned a deficiency in him. How different he was from young Plymdale or\r\n",
      "Mr. Caius Larcher! Those young men had not a notion of French, and could speak\r\n",
      "on no subject with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying\r\n",
      "trades, which of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch\r\n",
      "gentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but embarrassed\r\n",
      "in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above them, having at least\r\n",
      "the accent and manner of a university man. Whereas Lydgate was always listened\r\n",
      "to, bore himself with the careless politeness of conscious superiority, and\r\n",
      "seemed to have the right clothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever\r\n",
      "having to think about them. Rosamond was proud when he entered the room, and\r\n",
      "when he approached her with a distinguishing smile, she had a delicious sense\r\n",
      "that she was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware of all\r\n",
      "the pride he excited in that delicate bosom, he might have been just as well\r\n",
      "pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant of humoral pathology\r\n",
      "or fibrous tissue: he held it one of the prettiest attitudes of the feminine\r\n",
      "mind to adore a man’s pre-eminence without too precise a knowledge of what it\r\n",
      "consisted in. But Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls who betray\r\n",
      "themselves unawares, and whose behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses,\r\n",
      "instead of being steered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her\r\n",
      "rapid forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were ever\r\n",
      "discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the contrary, she\r\n",
      "would have expressed the prettiest surprise and disapprobation if she had heard\r\n",
      "that another young lady had been detected in that immodest\r\n",
      "prematureness—indeed, would probably have disbelieved in its possibility. For\r\n",

      "of correct sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private\r\n",
      "album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the\r\n",
      "irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair evil of\r\n",
      "her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or mercenary; in fact, she\r\n",
      "never thought of money except as something necessary which other people would\r\n",
      "always provide. She was not in the habit of devising falsehoods, and if her\r\n",
      "statements were no direct clew to fact, why, they were not intended in that\r\n",
      "light—they were among her elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature\r\n",
      "had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon’s favorite pupil, who by general\r\n",
      "consent (Fred’s excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and\r\n",

      "and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for them, which is\r\n",
      "observable with some sense of flatness by a third person; still they had no\r\n",
      "interviews or asides from which a third person need have been excluded. In\r\n",

      "the same time? Really, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were\r\n",
      "great bores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards: what\r\n",
      "was he to do for relaxation? He was often invited to the Bulstrodes’; but the\r\n",
      "girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and Mrs. Bulstrode’s\r\n",
      "naive way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the nothingness of this\r\n",
      "life and the desirability of cut glass, the consciousness at once of filthy\r\n",
      "rags and the best damask, was not a sufficient relief from the weight of her\r\n",

      "copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic verses as\r\n",
      "capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was gracious, and Mr.\r\n",

      "reasons, deep rather than ostensible, for being satisfied with his own\r\n",
      "appearance. To superficial observers his chin had too vanishing an aspect,\r\n",
      "looking as if it were being gradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,” said Mr. Ned. He kept\r\n",

      "languishingly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her back is very large; she seems to have sat for that,” said Rosamond, not\r\n",
      "meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale’s hands were, and\r\n",
      "wondering why Lydgate did not come. She went on with her tatting all the while.\r\n",

      "quickly, seeming to see all through the book in no time, and showing his large\r\n",
      "white hands to much advantage, as Rosamond thought. “Do look at this bridegroom\r\n",
      "coming out of church: did you ever see such a ‘sugared invention’—as the\r\n",
      "Elizabethans used to say? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will\r\n",

      "“There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ‘Keepsake,’ at all\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I read no literature now,” said Lydgate, shutting the book, and pushing it\r\n",

      "had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness.\r\n",
      "Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a moral imprisonment which made\r\n",

      "uninterpreted. The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea:\r\n",

      "in marrying—nothing but what society sanctions, and considers an occasion for\r\n",
      "wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him that he must not any longer defer\r\n",

      "of good position should expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady—the\r\n",
      "younger the better, because more educable and submissive—of a rank equal to his\r\n",
      "own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good understanding. On\r\n",
      "such a young lady he would make handsome settlements, and he would neglect no\r\n",
      "arrangement for her happiness: in return, he should receive family pleasures\r\n",
      "and leave behind him that copy of himself which seemed so urgently required of\r\n",
      "a man—to the sonneteers of the sixteenth century. Times had altered since then,\r\n",
      "and no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon’s leaving a copy of himself;\r\n",
      "moreover, he had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his mythological key;\r\n",
      "but he had always intended to acquit himself by marriage, and the sense that he\r\n",
      "was fast leaving the years behind him, that the world was getting dimmer and\r\n",
      "that he felt lonely, was a reason to him for losing no more time in overtaking\r\n",

      "husband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke\r\n",
      "in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to\r\n",
      "him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much\r\n",
      "about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of\r\n",
      "hers for making himself happy. As if a man could choose not only his wife but\r\n",
      "his wife’s husband! Or as if he were bound to provide charms for his posterity\r\n",
      "in his own person!— When Dorothea accepted him with effusion, that was only\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He had not had much foretaste of happiness in his previous life. To know\r\n",
      "intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an enthusiastic soul.\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame, and his soul was sensitive\r\n",
      "without being enthusiastic: it was too languid to thrill out of\r\n",
      "self-consciousness into passionate delight; it went on fluttering in the swampy\r\n",
      "ground where it was hatched, thinking of its wings and never flying. His\r\n",
      "experience was of that pitiable kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of\r\n",
      "all that it should be known: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has\r\n",
      "not mass enough to spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers\r\n",
      "thread-like in small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic\r\n",
      "scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he was capable of a severe\r\n",
      "self-restraint; he was resolute in being a man of honor according to the code;\r\n",
      "he would be unimpeachable by any recognized opinion. In conduct these ends had\r\n",
      "been attained; but the difficulty of making his Key to all Mythologies\r\n",
      "unimpeachable weighed like lead upon his mind; and the pamphlets—or “Parerga”\r\n",
      "as he called them—by which he tested his public and deposited small monumental\r\n",
      "records of his march, were far from having been seen in all their significance.\r\n",
      "He suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them; he was in painful doubt as\r\n",
      "to what was really thought of them by the leading minds of Brasenose, and\r\n",
      "bitterly convinced that his old acquaintance Carp had been the writer of that\r\n",
      "depreciatory recension which was kept locked in a small drawer of Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s desk, and also in a dark closet of his verbal memory. These were\r\n",
      "heavy impressions to struggle against, and brought that melancholy embitterment\r\n",
      "which is the consequence of all excessive claim: even his religious faith\r\n",
      "wavered with his wavering trust in his own authorship, and the consolations of\r\n",
      "the Christian hope in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the\r\n",
      "still unwritten Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him. It\r\n",
      "is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to\r\n",
      "enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated\r\n",
      "from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we\r\n",
      "behold, never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the\r\n",
      "vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy of an action, but\r\n",
      "always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and\r\n",
      "dim-sighted. Becoming a dean or even a bishop would make little difference, I\r\n",
      "fear, to Mr. Casaubon’s uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed\r\n",
      "that behind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our\r\n",
      "poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under\r\n",
      "anxious control.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to\r\n",
      "sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing happiness\r\n",
      "with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we have seen, he found\r\n",
      "himself under a new depression in the consciousness that the new bliss was not\r\n",
      "blissful to him. Inclination yearned back to its old, easier custom. And the\r\n",
      "deeper he went in domesticity the more did the sense of acquitting himself and\r\n",
      "acting with propriety predominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like\r\n",
      "religion and erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an\r\n",
      "outward requirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably\r\n",
      "all requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his study, according to his\r\n",
      "own intention before marriage, was an effort which he was always tempted to\r\n",
      "defer, and but for her pleading insistence it might never have begun. But she\r\n",
      "had succeeded in making it a matter of course that she should take her place at\r\n",
      "an early hour in the library and have work either of reading aloud or copying\r\n",
      "assigned her. The work had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "adopted an immediate intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small\r\n",
      "monograph on some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries\r\n",
      "whereby certain assertions of Warburton’s could be corrected. References were\r\n",
      "extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and sentences were actually\r\n",
      "to be written in the shape wherein they would be scanned by Brasenose and a\r\n",
      "less formidable posterity. These minor monumental productions were always\r\n",
      "exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion was made difficult by the interference of\r\n",
      "citations, or by the rivalry of dialectical phrases ringing against each other\r\n",
      "in his brain. And from the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which\r\n",
      "everything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to Carp: it was\r\n",
      "a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he had once addressed a dedication to\r\n",
      "Carp in which he had numbered that member of the animal kingdom among the\r\n",
      "viros nullo ævo perituros, a mistake which would infallibly lay the\r\n",
      "dedicator open to ridicule in the next age, and might even be chuckled over by\r\n",
      "Pike and Tench in the present.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his busiest epochs, and as I began to say a\r\n",
      "little while ago, Dorothea joined him early in the library where he had\r\n",
      "breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to Lowick, probably\r\n",
      "the last before her marriage, and was in the drawing-room expecting Sir James.\r\n",

      "Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her husband’s mood, and she saw that\r\n",
      "the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour. She was going\r\n",

      "that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a visit here. I trust I may\r\n",

      "desire visits which might be disagreeable to her husband, this gratuitous\r\n",
      "defence of himself against selfish complaint on her part, was too sharp a sting\r\n",
      "to be meditated on until after it had been resented. Dorothea had thought that\r\n",

      "men—a too eager and monotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied\r\n",
      "with moderate work, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by\r\n",

      "Clinker:’ they are a little broad, but she may read anything now she’s married,\r\n",

      "in her face and voice about whatever touched his mind or health, made a drama\r\n",

      "right in telling her the truth about her husband’s probable future, but he\r\n",
      "certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk confidentially with\r\n",
      "her. A medical man likes to make psychological observations, and sometimes in\r\n",
      "the pursuit of such studies is too easily tempted into momentous prophecy which\r\n",
      "life and death easily set at nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this\r\n",

      "opened the library door which happened to be the nearest, thinking of nothing\r\n",
      "at the moment but what he might have to say about Mr. Casaubon. It was the\r\n",
      "first time she had entered this room since her husband had been taken ill, and\r\n",

      "\n",

      "\r\n",

      "which, if I had known it, would have made me act differently.” The words came\r\n",
      "out like a cry: it was evident that they were the voice of some mental\r\n",

      "But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon’s case is precisely of the kind in\r\n",

      "circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger from that affection of\r\n",
      "the heart, which I believe to have been the cause of his late attack. On the\r\n",
      "other hand, it is possible that the disease may develop itself more rapidly: it\r\n",

      "usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and met her in walking-dress, was\r\n",
      "almost as expensively equipped. Mrs. Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition\r\n",

      "quilling inside Rosamond’s bonnet was so charming that it was impossible not to\r\n",

      "dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that you have\r\n",
      "refused!—and one still within your reach, if you will not throw it away. I knew\r\n",
      "a very great beauty who married badly at last, by doing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is\r\n",
      "a nice young man—some might think good-looking; and an only son; and a large\r\n",
      "business of that kind is better than a profession. Not that marrying is\r\n",
      "everything. I would have you seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have already refused\r\n",

      "a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the part prettily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see how it is, my dear,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice, rising\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what his\r\n",

      "next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr. Lydgate whether he had\r\n",
      "any intention of marrying soon. The result was a decided negative. Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed that Lydgate had spoken as no man\r\n",
      "would who had any attachment that could issue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now\r\n",
      "felt that she had a serious duty before her, and she soon managed to arrange a\r\n",
      "tête-à-tête with Lydgate, in which she passed from inquiries about Fred\r\n",
      "Vincy’s health, and expressions of her sincere anxiety for her brother’s large\r\n",
      "family, to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people with\r\n",
      "regard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and\r\n",
      "disappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a girl was\r\n",
      "exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her prospects.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Especially when she has great attractions, and her parents see much company,”\r\n",

      "think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, to interfere with the\r\n",
      "prospects of any girl.” Here Mrs. Bulstrode fixed her eyes on him, with an\r\n",
      "unmistakable purpose of warning, if not of rebuke.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clearly,” said Lydgate, looking at her—perhaps even staring a little in\r\n",
      "return. “On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go about with a\r\n",
      "notion that he must not pay attention to a young lady lest she should fall in\r\n",

      "which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying\r\n",
      "buried there in no sealed sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced\r\n",

      "tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him\r\n",
      "for her joy, actually put his arms round her, folding her gently and\r\n",
      "protectingly—he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering—and kissed\r\n",
      "each of the two large tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an\r\n",

      "backward a little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit near her and\r\n",
      "speak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her little confession, and he\r\n",
      "poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment. In half\r\n",

      "character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely distributed placards, and who\r\n",
      "might reasonably be sorry for those who did not know of him. He was second\r\n",
      "cousin to Peter Featherstone, and had been treated by him with more amenity\r\n",
      "than any other relative, being useful in matters of business; and in that\r\n",
      "programme of his funeral which the old man had himself dictated, he had been\r\n",
      "named as a Bearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop\r\n",
      "Trumbull—nothing more than a sincere sense of his own merit, which, he was\r\n",
      "aware, in case of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter\r\n",
      "Featherstone, who so far as he, Trumbull, was concerned, had behaved like as\r\n",
      "good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything handsome by him, all he\r\n",
      "could say was, that he had never fished and fawned, but had advised him to the\r\n",
      "best of his experience, which now extended over twenty years from the time of\r\n",
      "his apprenticeship at fifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no\r\n",
      "surreptitious kind. His admiration was far from being confined to himself, but\r\n",
      "was accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating\r\n",
      "things at a high rate. He was an amateur of superior phrases, and never used\r\n",
      "poor language without immediately correcting himself—which was fortunate, as he\r\n",
      "was rather loud, and given to predominate, standing or walking about\r\n",
      "frequently, pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a man who is very much\r\n",
      "of his own opinion, trimming himself rapidly with his fore-finger, and marking\r\n",
      "each new series in these movements by a busy play with his large seals. There\r\n",
      "was occasionally a little fierceness in his demeanor, but it was directed\r\n",
      "chiefly against false opinion, of which there is so much to correct in the\r\n",
      "world that a man of some reading and experience necessarily has his patience\r\n",
      "tried. He felt that the Featherstone family generally was of limited\r\n",
      "understanding, but being a man of the world and a public character, took\r\n",
      "everything as a matter of course, and even went to converse with Mr. Jonah and\r\n",
      "young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting that he had impressed the latter\r\n",
      "greatly by his leading questions concerning the Chalky Flats. If anybody had\r\n",
      "observed that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being an auctioneer, was bound to know the\r\n",
      "nature of everything, he would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with\r\n",
      "the sense that he came pretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering way,\r\n",
      "he was an honorable man, not ashamed of his business, and feeling that “the\r\n",
      "celebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,” if introduced to him, would not fail to\r\n",
      "recognize his importance.\r\n",

      "“I don’t mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale, Miss\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! seeing the old man?” said the auctioneer, playing with his seals\r\n",
      "dispassionately. “Ah, you see he has relied on me considerably.” Here he\r\n",
      "pressed his lips together, and frowned meditatively.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?” said Solomon, in a soft\r\n",
      "tone of humility, in which he had a sense of luxurious cunning, he being a rich\r\n",
      "man and not in need of it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes, anybody may ask,” said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and good-humored though\r\n",
      "cutting sarcasm. “Anybody may interrogate. Any one may give their remarks an\r\n",
      "interrogative turn,” he continued, his sonorousness rising with his style.\r\n",
      "“This is constantly done by good speakers, even when they anticipate no answer.\r\n",
      "It is what we call a figure of speech—speech at a high figure, as one may say.”\r\n",
      "The eloquent auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shouldn’t be sorry to hear he’d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,” said Solomon.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,” said Mr. Trumbull, significantly. “It\r\n",
      "can’t be denied that undeserving people have been legatees, and even residuary\r\n",
      "legatees. It is so, with testamentary dispositions.” Again he pursed up his\r\n",
      "lips and frowned a little.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left his\r\n",
      "land away from our family?” said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an unhopeful woman,\r\n",
      "those long words had a depressing effect.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave it to\r\n",
      "some people,” observed Solomon, his sister’s question having drawn no answer.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, Blue-Coat land?” said Mrs. Waule, again. “Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you never\r\n",

      "prospered him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from the\r\n",
      "fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his fore-finger round the inside\r\n",
      "of his stock, then along his whiskers and the curves of his hair. He now walked\r\n",
      "to Miss Garth’s work-table, opened a book which lay there and read the title\r\n",
      "aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were offering it for sale:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“‘Anne of Geierstein’ (pronounced Jeersteen) or the ‘Maiden of the Mist, by the\r\n",
      "author of Waverley.’” Then turning the page, he began sonorously—“The course of\r\n",
      "four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since the series of events which are\r\n",
      "related in the following chapters took place on the Continent.” He pronounced\r\n",
      "the last truly admirable word with the accent on the last syllable, not as\r\n",
      "unaware of vulgar usage, but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the\r\n",
      "sonorous beauty which his reading had given to the whole.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for answering\r\n",
      "Mrs. Waule’s question had gone by safely, while she and Solomon, watching Mr.\r\n",
      "Trumbull’s movements, were thinking that high learning interfered sadly with\r\n",
      "serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull really knew nothing about old\r\n",
      "Featherstone’s will; but he could hardly have been brought to declare any\r\n",
      "ignorance unless he had been arrested for misprision of treason.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,” he said,\r\n",
      "reassuringly. “As a man with public business, I take a snack when I can. I will\r\n",
      "back this ham,” he added, after swallowing some morsels with alarming haste,\r\n",
      "“against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my opinion it is better than the\r\n",
      "hams at Freshitt Hall—and I think I am a tolerable judge.”\r\n",

      "“If any person demands better, he is at liberty to do so; but, God bless me,\r\n",
      "what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I know. There is some\r\n",
      "gratification to a gentleman”—here Mr. Trumbull’s voice conveyed an emotional\r\n",
      "remonstrance—“in having this kind of ham set on his table.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pushed aside his plate, poured out his glass of ale and drew his chair a\r\n",
      "little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner side of his\r\n",
      "legs, which he stroked approvingly—Mr. Trumbull having all those less frivolous\r\n",

      "“You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,” he observed, when Mary\r\n",
      "re-entered. “It is by the author of ‘Waverley’: that is Sir Walter Scott. I\r\n",
      "have bought one of his works myself—a very nice thing, a very superior\r\n",
      "publication, entitled ‘Ivanhoe.’ You will not get any writer to beat him in a\r\n",
      "hurry, I think—he will not, in my opinion, be speedily surpassed. I have just\r\n",

      "pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck, and others. I shall be\r\n",

      "“A sensible girl though, in my opinion,” said Mr. Trumbull, finishing his ale\r\n",

      "her when she has been mixing medicine in drops. She minds what she is doing,\r\n",
      "sir. That is a great point in a woman, and a great point for our friend\r\n",
      "up-stairs, poor dear old soul. A man whose life is of any value should think of\r\n",
      "his wife as a nurse: that is what I should do, if I married; and I believe I\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man on the\r\n",
      "bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an aged creature\r\n",
      "whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of vices. She had always seen\r\n",
      "the most disagreeable side of Mr. Featherstone: he was not proud of her, and\r\n",
      "she was only useful to him. To be anxious about a soul that is always snapping\r\n",
      "at you must be left to the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them.\r\n",
      "She had never returned him a harsh word, and had waited on him faithfully: that\r\n",
      "was her utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious about his\r\n",
      "soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To-night he had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he lay remarkably\r\n",
      "still, until at last Mary heard him rattling his bunch of keys against the tin\r\n",
      "box which he always kept in the bed beside him. About three o’clock he said,\r\n",
      "with remarkable distinctness, “Missy, come here!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary obeyed, and found that he had already drawn the tin box from under the\r\n",
      "clothes, though he usually asked to have this done for him; and he had selected\r\n",
      "the key. He now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it another key, looked\r\n",
      "straight at her with eyes that seemed to have recovered all their sharpness and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean of your own relations, sir,” said Mary, well used to the old man’s\r\n",

      "counting and casting up?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the others come often.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man listened with a grimace while she spoke, and then said, relaxing\r\n",
      "his face, “The more fools they. You hearken, missy. It’s three o’clock in the\r\n",
      "morning, and I’ve got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life. I know\r\n",
      "all my property, and where the money’s put out, and everything. And I’ve made\r\n",
      "everything ready to change my mind, and do as I like at the last. Do you hear,\r\n",
      "missy? I’ve got my faculties.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, sir?” said Mary, quietly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He now lowered his tone with an air of deeper cunning. “I’ve made two wills,\r\n",
      "and I’m going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is the key of my iron\r\n",
      "chest, in the closet there. You push well at the side of the brass plate at the\r\n",
      "top, till it goes like a bolt: then you can put the key in the front lock and\r\n",
      "turn it. See and do that; and take out the topmost paper—Last Will and\r\n",
      "Testament—big printed.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not do it? I tell you, you must,” said the old man, his voice beginning to\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do anything that\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you, I’m in my right mind. Shan’t I do as I like at the last? I made\r\n",

      "\n",

      "a little distance from the bedside.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the one key\r\n",
      "erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he began to work with his bony\r\n",
      "left hand at emptying the tin box before him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Missy,” he began to say, hurriedly, “look here! take the money—the notes and\r\n",
      "gold—look here—take it—you shall have it all—do as I tell you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made an effort to stretch out the key towards her as far as possible, and\r\n",
      "Mary again retreated.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don’t ask me to do it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He let his hand fall, and for the first time in her life Mary saw old Peter\r\n",
      "Featherstone begin to cry childishly. She said, in as gentle a tone as she\r\n",
      "could command, “Pray put up your money, sir;” and then went away to her seat by\r\n",
      "the fire, hoping this would help to convince him that it was useless to say\r\n",
      "more. Presently he rallied and said eagerly—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary’s heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through her mind\r\n",
      "as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She had to make a\r\n",
      "difficult decision in a hurry.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "“Let me call some one else, sir,” said Mary, persuasively. She did not like her\r\n",
      "position—alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange flaring of\r\n",
      "nervous energy which enabled him to speak again and again without falling into\r\n",
      "his usual cough; yet she desired not to push unnecessarily the contradiction\r\n",
      "which agitated him. “Let me, pray, call some one else.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You’ll never have\r\n",
      "the chance again. It’s pretty nigh two hundred—there’s more in the box, and\r\n",
      "nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do as I tell you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man, propped\r\n",
      "up on his pillows and bed-rest, with his bony hand holding out the key, and the\r\n",
      "money lying on the quilt before him. She never forgot that vision of a man\r\n",
      "wanting to do as he liked at the last. But the way in which he had put the\r\n",
      "offer of the money urged her to speak with harder resolution than ever.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will not touch\r\n",

      "your keys or your money.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Anything else—anything else!” said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage, which,\r\n",
      "as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just audible. “I want\r\n",
      "nothing else. You come here—you come here.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. She saw him dropping his\r\n",
      "keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her like an aged hyena,\r\n",
      "the muscles of his face getting distorted with the effort of his hand. She\r\n",
      "paused at a safe distance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compose\r\n",
      "yourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you can do as\r\n",
      "you like.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lifted the stick, in spite of her being beyond his reach, and threw it with\r\n",
      "a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over the foot of the\r\n",
      "bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her chair by the fire. By-and-by she\r\n",
      "would go to him with the cordial. Fatigue would make him passive. It was\r\n",
      "getting towards the chillest moment of the morning, the fire had got low, and\r\n",
      "she could see through the chink between the moreen window-curtains the light\r\n",
      "whitened by the blind. Having put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over\r\n",
      "her, she sat down, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she\r\n",
      "went near him the irritation might be kept up. He had said nothing after\r\n",
      "throwing the stick, but she had seen him taking his keys again and laying his\r\n",
      "right hand on the money. He did not put it up, however, and she thought that he\r\n",
      "was dropping off to sleep.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what she had\r\n",
      "gone through, than she had been by the reality—questioning those acts of hers\r\n",
      "which had come imperatively and excluded all question in the critical moment.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every crevice, and\r\n",
      "Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his head turned a little on\r\n",
      "one side. She went towards him with inaudible steps, and thought that his face\r\n",
      "looked strangely motionless; but the next moment the movement of the flame\r\n",
      "communicating itself to all objects made her uncertain. The violent beating of\r\n",
      "her heart rendered her perceptions so doubtful that even when she touched him\r\n",
      "and listened for his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions. She went\r\n",
      "to the window and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the still\r\n",
      "light of the sky fell on the bed.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next moment she ran to the bell and rang it energetically. In a very little\r\n",

      "now and then allowed a gleam to light up any object, whether ugly or beautiful,\r\n",
      "that happened to stand within its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects\r\n",
      "were remarkably various, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see\r\n",
      "the funeral. The news had spread that it was to be a “big burying;” the old\r\n",
      "gentleman had left written directions about everything and meant to have a\r\n",
      "funeral “beyond his betters.” This was true; for old Featherstone had not been\r\n",
      "a Harpagon whose passions had all been devoured by the ever-lean and\r\n",
      "ever-hungry passion of saving, and who would drive a bargain with his\r\n",
      "undertaker beforehand. He loved money, but he also loved to spend it in\r\n",
      "gratifying his peculiar tastes, and perhaps he loved it best of all as a means\r\n",
      "of making others feel his power more or less uncomfortably. If any one will\r\n",
      "here contend that there must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone,\r\n",
      "I will not presume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a\r\n",
      "modest nature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early life\r\n",
      "by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that it is more\r\n",
      "easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old gentleman\r\n",
      "theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments based on his\r\n",
      "personal acquaintance. In any case, he had been bent on having a handsome\r\n",
      "funeral, and on having persons “bid” to it who would rather have stayed at\r\n",
      "home. He had even desired that female relatives should follow him to the grave,\r\n",
      "and poor sister Martha had taken a difficult journey for this purpose from the\r\n",
      "Chalky Flats. She and Jane would have been altogether cheered (in a tearful\r\n",
      "manner) by this sign that a brother who disliked seeing them while he was\r\n",
      "living had been prospectively fond of their presence when he should have become\r\n",
      "a testator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most presumptuous\r\n",
      "hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told pretty plainly that she\r\n",
      "was not a blood-relation, but of that generally objectionable class called\r\n",
      "wife’s kin.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the brood of\r\n",
      "desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way in which others\r\n",
      "cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of illusion. In writing the\r\n",
      "programme for his burial he certainly did not make clear to himself that his\r\n",
      "pleasure in the little drama of which it formed a part was confined to\r\n",
      "anticipation. In chuckling over the vexations he could inflict by the rigid\r\n",
      "clutch of his dead hand, he inevitably mingled his consciousness with that\r\n",
      "livid stagnant presence, and so far as he was preoccupied with a future life,\r\n",
      "it was with one of gratification inside his coffin. Thus old Featherstone was\r\n",
      "imaginative, after his fashion.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the written orders\r\n",
      "of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback, with the richest scarfs\r\n",
      "and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had trappings of woe which were of a\r\n",
      "good well-priced quality. The black procession, when dismounted, looked the\r\n",
      "larger for the smallness of the churchyard; the heavy human faces and the black\r\n",
      "draperies shivering in the wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous\r\n",
      "with the lightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.\r\n",
      "The clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader—also according to the\r\n",
      "request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by peculiar reasons. Having a\r\n",
      "contempt for curates, whom he always called understrappers, he was resolved to\r\n",
      "be buried by a beneficed clergyman. Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not\r\n",
      "merely because he declined duty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an\r\n",
      "especial dislike to him as the rector of his own parish, who had a lien on the\r\n",
      "land in the shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the\r\n",
      "old man, being in his pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit\r\n",
      "through with an inward snarl. He had an objection to a parson stuck up above\r\n",
      "his head preaching to him. But his relations with Mr. Cadwallader had been of a\r\n",
      "different kind: the trout-stream which ran through Mr. Casaubon’s land took its\r\n",
      "course through Featherstone’s also, so that Mr. Cadwallader was a parson who\r\n",
      "had had to ask a favor instead of preaching. Moreover, he was one of the high\r\n",
      "gentry living four miles away from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky\r\n",
      "with the sheriff of the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as\r\n",
      "necessary to the system of things. There would be a satisfaction in being\r\n",
      "buried by Mr. Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for\r\n",
      "pronouncing wrongly if you liked.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the reason\r\n",
      "why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old Featherstone’s\r\n",
      "funeral from an upper window of the manor. She was not fond of visiting that\r\n",
      "house, but she liked, as she said, to see collections of strange animals such\r\n",
      "as there would be at this funeral; and she had persuaded Sir James and the\r\n",

      "which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea’s nature. The country gentry of old\r\n",
      "time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart on their stations up the\r\n",
      "mountain they looked down with imperfect discrimination on the belts of thicker\r\n",

      "There you are to the very life—as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of\r\n",

      "Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her uncle’s was about as pleasant as a\r\n",
      "grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether unfitting now\r\n",
      "to explain that she had not wished her uncle to invite Will Ladislaw. She could\r\n",
      "not in the least make clear to herself the reasons for her husband’s dislike to\r\n",
      "his presence—a dislike painfully impressed on her by the scene in the library;\r\n",
      "but she felt the unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion\r\n",
      "of it to others. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those\r\n",
      "mixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of us,\r\n",
      "seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he wished to\r\n",
      "repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the changes in her\r\n",

      "to everybody, as if he saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the\r\n",
      "hay-crop, which would be “very fine, by God!” of the last bulletins concerning\r\n",

      "contrary, he rather enjoyed the zest of a little curiosity in his own mind,\r\n",

      "to create endless “lawing” before anybody came by their own—an inconvenience\r\n",
      "which would have at least the advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers\r\n",

      "subtly, as if some faint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr.\r\n",

      "more important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests\r\n",
      "which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him. Fred blushed,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was another\r\n",
      "will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could not quell the\r\n",
      "rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done well by in every tense,\r\n",
      "past, present, and future. And here was Peter capable five years ago of leaving\r\n",
      "only two hundred apiece to his own brothers and sisters, and only a hundred\r\n",
      "apiece to his own nephews and nieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs.\r\n",
      "Vincy and Rosamond were each to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the\r\n",
      "gold-headed cane and fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins\r\n",
      "present were each to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin\r\n",
      "observed, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was much more\r\n",
      "of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not present—problematical, and,\r\n",
      "it was to be feared, low connections. Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were\r\n",
      "about three thousand disposed of. Where then had Peter meant the rest of the\r\n",
      "money to go—and where the land? and what was revoked and what not revoked—and\r\n",
      "was the revocation for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional,\r\n",
      "and might turn out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to bear up\r\n",
      "and keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their lower lip fall,\r\n",
      "others pursing it up, according to the habit of their muscles. But Jane and\r\n",
      "Martha sank under the rush of questions, and began to cry; poor Mrs. Cranch\r\n",
      "being half moved with the consolation of getting any hundreds at all without\r\n",
      "working for them, and half aware that her share was scanty; whereas Mrs.\r\n",
      "Waule’s mind was entirely flooded with the sense of being an own sister and\r\n",
      "getting little, while somebody else was to have much. The general expectation\r\n",
      "now was that the “much” would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves\r\n",
      "were surprised when ten thousand pounds in specified investments were declared\r\n",
      "to be bequeathed to him:—was the land coming too? Fred bit his lips: it was\r\n",
      "difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the happiest of\r\n",

      "There was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but the\r\n",

      "florid men; and the circumstance called Rosamond was particularly forcible by\r\n",
      "means of that mild persistence which, as we know, enables a white soft living\r\n",
      "substance to make its way in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he\r\n",
      "had no other fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called\r\n",
      "habit, and this was altogether unfavorable to his taking the only decisive line\r\n",
      "of conduct in relation to his daughter’s engagement—namely, to inquire\r\n",
      "thoroughly into Lydgate’s circumstances, declare his own inability to furnish\r\n",
      "money, and forbid alike either a speedy marriage or an engagement which must be\r\n",
      "too lengthy. That seems very simple and easy in the statement; but a\r\n",
      "disagreeable resolve formed in the chill hours of the morning had as many\r\n",
      "conditions against it as the early frost, and rarely persisted under the\r\n",
      "warming influences of the day. The indirect though emphatic expression of\r\n",
      "opinion to which Mr. Vincy was prone suffered much restraint in this case:\r\n",
      "Lydgate was a proud man towards whom innuendoes were obviously unsafe, and\r\n",
      "throwing his hat on the floor was out of the question. Mr. Vincy was a little\r\n",
      "in awe of him, a little vain that he wanted to marry Rosamond, a little\r\n",
      "indisposed to raise a question of money in which his own position was not\r\n",
      "advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in dialogue with a man better\r\n",
      "educated and more highly bred than himself, and a little afraid of doing what\r\n",
      "his daughter would not like. The part Mr. Vincy preferred playing was that of\r\n",
      "the generous host whom nobody criticises. In the earlier half of the day there\r\n",
      "was business to hinder any formal communication of an adverse resolve; in the\r\n",
      "later there was dinner, wine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the mean\r\n",
      "while the hours were each leaving their little deposit and gradually forming\r\n",
      "the final reason for inaction, namely, that action was too late. The accepted\r\n",
      "lover spent most of his evenings in Lowick Gate, and a love-making not at all\r\n",
      "dependent on money-advances from fathers-in-law, or prospective income from a\r\n",
      "profession, went on flourishingly under Mr. Vincy’s own eyes. Young\r\n",
      "love-making—that gossamer web! Even the points it clings to—the things whence\r\n",
      "its subtle interlacings are swung—are scarcely perceptible: momentary touches\r\n",
      "of fingertips, meetings of rays from blue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases,\r\n",
      "lightest changes of cheek and lip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of\r\n",
      "spontaneous beliefs and indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards\r\n",
      "another, visions of completeness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to\r\n",
      "spinning that web from his inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of\r\n",
      "experience supposed to be finished off with the drama of Laure—in spite too of\r\n",
      "medicine and biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes\r\n",
      "presented in a dish (like Santa Lucia’s), and other incidents of scientific\r\n",
      "inquiry, are observed to be less incompatible with poetic love than a native\r\n",
      "dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose. As for Rosamond, she was in\r\n",
      "the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at its own fuller life, and she too was\r\n",
      "spinning industriously at the mutual web. All this went on in the corner of the\r\n",
      "drawing-room where the piano stood, and subtle as it was, the light made it a\r\n",
      "sort of rainbow visible to many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The\r\n",
      "certainty that Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch without the aid of formal announcement.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time she addressed\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go on\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town without\r\n",
      "any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against Lydgate? Bulstrode has\r\n",
      "pushed him forward more than anybody. I never made any fuss about the young\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him by the hand, I should never have invited\r\n",
      "him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you called him in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a mercy,” said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know about mercy,” said Mr. Vincy, testily. “I know I am worried more\r\n",

      "married Bulstrode, and I must say he doesn’t always show that friendly spirit\r\n",
      "towards your family that might have been expected of him.” Mr. Vincy was very\r\n",
      "little like a Jesuit, but no accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question\r\n",
      "more adroitly. Harriet had to defend her husband instead of blaming her\r\n",
      "brother, and the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as\r\n",
      "some recent sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode did not repeat her brother’s complaints to her husband, but in\r\n",
      "the evening she spoke to him of Lydgate and Rosamond. He did not share her warm\r\n",
      "interest, however; and only spoke with resignation of the risks attendant on\r\n",
      "the beginning of medical practice and the desirability of prudence.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl—brought up as she has\r\n",
      "been,” said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her husband’s feelings.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Truly, my dear,” said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. “Those who are not of this\r\n",
      "world can do little else to arrest the errors of the obstinately worldly. That\r\n",
      "is what we must accustom ourselves to recognize with regard to your brother’s\r\n",
      "family. I could have wished that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union;\r\n",
      "but my relations with him are limited to that use of his gifts for God’s\r\n",
      "purposes which is taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she felt to\r\n",
      "her own want of spirituality. She believed that her husband was one of those\r\n",
      "men whose memoirs should be written when they died.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he was prepared to accept all the\r\n",
      "consequences which he believed himself to foresee with perfect clearness. Of\r\n",
      "course he must be married in a year—perhaps even in half a year. This was not\r\n",
      "what he had intended; but other schemes would not be hindered: they would\r\n",
      "simply adjust themselves anew. Marriage, of course, must be prepared for in the\r\n",
      "usual way. A house must be taken instead of the rooms he at present occupied;\r\n",
      "and Lydgate, having heard Rosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton’s\r\n",
      "house (situated in Lowick Gate), took notice when it fell vacant after the old\r\n",
      "lady’s death, and immediately entered into treaty for it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did this in an episodic way, very much as he gave orders to his tailor for\r\n",
      "every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of being extravagant. On\r\n",
      "the contrary, he would have despised any ostentation of expense; his profession\r\n",
      "had familiarized him with all grades of poverty, and he cared much for those\r\n",
      "who suffered hardships. He would have behaved perfectly at a table where the\r\n",
      "sauce was served in a jug with the handle off, and he would have remembered\r\n",
      "nothing about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But\r\n",
      "it had never occurred to him that he should live in any other than what he\r\n",
      "would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and excellent\r\n",
      "waiting at table. In warming himself at French social theories he had brought\r\n",
      "away no smell of scorching. We may handle even extreme opinions with impunity\r\n",
      "while our furniture, our dinner-giving, and preference for armorial bearings in\r\n",
      "our own case, link us indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "tendency was not towards extreme opinions: he would have liked no barefooted\r\n",
      "doctrines, being particular about his boots: he was no radical in relation to\r\n",
      "anything but medical reform and the prosecution of discovery. In the rest of\r\n",
      "practical life he walked by hereditary habit; half from that personal pride and\r\n",
      "unreflecting egoism which I have already called commonness, and half from that\r\n",
      "naivete which belonged to preoccupation with favorite ideas.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement which\r\n",
      "had stolen upon him, turned on the paucity of time rather than of money.\r\n",
      "Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some one who always\r\n",
      "turned out to be prettier than memory could represent her to be, did interfere\r\n",
      "with the diligent use of spare hours which might serve some “plodding fellow of\r\n",
      "a German” to make the great, imminent discovery. This was really an argument\r\n",
      "for not deferring the marriage too long, as he implied to Mr. Farebrother, one\r\n",
      "day that the Vicar came to his room with some pond-products which he wanted to\r\n",
      "examine under a better microscope than his own, and, finding Lydgate’s tableful\r\n",
      "of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eros has degenerated; he began by introducing order and harmony, and now he\r\n",
      "brings back chaos.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, at some stages,” said Lydgate, lifting his brows and smiling, while he\r\n",
      "began to arrange his microscope. “But a better order will begin after.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Soon?” said the Vicar.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time, and when\r\n",
      "one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I feel sure that\r\n",
      "marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to work steadily. He has\r\n",
      "everything at home then—no teasing with personal speculations—he can get\r\n",
      "calmness and freedom.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are an enviable dog,” said the Vicar, “to have such a prospect—Rosamond,\r\n",

      "pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he had for wishing to\r\n",
      "shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him, even with the\r\n",
      "wine of love in his veins, to be obliged to mingle so often with the family\r\n",
      "party at the Vincys’, and to enter so much into Middlemarch gossip, protracted\r\n",
      "good cheer, whist-playing, and general futility. He had to be deferential when\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy decided questions with trenchant ignorance, especially as to those\r\n",
      "liquors which were the best inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of\r\n",
      "bad air. Mrs. Vincy’s openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with\r\n",
      "suspicion as to the subtle offence she might give to the taste of her intended\r\n",
      "son-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he was\r\n",
      "descending a little in relation to Rosamond’s family. But that exquisite\r\n",
      "creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:—it was at least one\r\n",
      "delightful thought that in marrying her, he could give her a much-needed\r\n",
      "transplantation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear!” he said to her one evening, in his gentlest tone, as he sat down by her\r\n",
      "and looked closely at her face—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I must first say that he had found her alone in the drawing-room, where the\r\n",
      "great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of the room, was opened\r\n",
      "to the summer scents of the garden at the back of the house. Her father and\r\n",

      "“Dear! your eyelids are red.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As if you could hide it from me!” said Lydgate, laying his hand tenderly on\r\n",
      "both of hers. “Don’t I see a tiny drop on one of the lashes? Things trouble\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him angry, and this morning\r\n",
      "there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his whole education\r\n",
      "away, and do something quite beneath him. And besides—”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond hesitated, and her cheeks were gathering a slight flush. Lydgate had\r\n",
      "never seen her in trouble since the morning of their engagement, and he had\r\n",
      "never felt so passionately towards her as at this moment. He kissed the\r\n",
      "hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,” Rosamond\r\n",
      "continued, almost in a whisper; “and he said last night that he should\r\n",
      "certainly speak to you and say it must be given up.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you give it up?” said Lydgate, with quick energy—almost angrily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I never give up anything that I choose to do,” said Rosamond, recovering her\r\n",
      "calmness at the touching of this chord.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God bless you!” said Lydgate, kissing her again. This constancy of purpose in\r\n",
      "the right place was adorable. He went on:—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be given\r\n",
      "up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is done to make you\r\n",
      "unhappy,—that is a reason for hastening our marriage.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his, and the\r\n",

      "(of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you are invited to step from\r\n",
      "the labor and discord of the street into a paradise where everything is given\r\n",
      "to you and nothing claimed) seemed to be an affair of a few weeks’ waiting,\r\n",
      "more or less.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should we defer it?” he said, with ardent insistence. “I have taken the\r\n",
      "house now: everything else can soon be got ready—can it not? You will not mind\r\n",
      "about new clothes. Those can be bought afterwards.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What original notions you clever men have!” said Rosamond, dimpling with more\r\n",
      "thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity. “This is the first\r\n",
      "time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought after marriage.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you don’t mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for the sake\r\n",
      "of clothes?” said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was tormenting him\r\n",
      "prettily, and half fearing that she really shrank from speedy marriage.\r\n",
      "“Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of happiness even than\r\n",
      "this—being continually together, independent of others, and ordering our lives\r\n",
      "as we will. Come, dear, tell me how soon you can be altogether mine.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a serious pleading in Lydgate’s tone, as if he felt that she would be\r\n",
      "injuring him by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious too, and slightly\r\n",
      "meditative; in fact, she was going through many intricacies of lace-edging and\r\n",
      "hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order to give an answer that would at least\r\n",
      "be approximative.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Six weeks would be ample—say so, Rosamond,” insisted Lydgate, releasing her\r\n",
      "hands to put his arm gently round her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One little hand immediately went to pat her hair, while she gave her neck a\r\n",
      "meditative turn, and then said seriously—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared. Still, mamma\r\n",
      "could see to those while we were away.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, to be sure. We must be away a week or so.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, more than that!” said Rosamond, earnestly. She was thinking of her evening\r\n",
      "dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate’s, which she had long been secretly\r\n",
      "hoping for as a delightful employment of at least one quarter of the honeymoon,\r\n",
      "even if she deferred her introduction to the uncle who was a doctor of divinity\r\n",
      "(also a pleasing though sober kind of rank, when sustained by blood). She\r\n",
      "looked at her lover with some wondering remonstrance as she spoke, and he\r\n",
      "readily understood that she might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double\r\n",
      "solitude.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take a\r\n",
      "decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be suffering. Six\r\n",
      "weeks!—I am sure they would be ample.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could certainly hasten the work,” said Rosamond. “Will you, then, mention it\r\n",
      "to papa?—I think it would be better to write to him.” She blushed and looked at\r\n",
      "him as the garden flowers look at us when we walk forth happily among them in\r\n",
      "the transcendent evening light: is there not a soul beyond utterance, half\r\n",
      "nymph, half child, in those delicate petals which glow and breathe about the\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He touched her ear and a little bit of neck under it with his lips, and they\r\n",
      "sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small gurgling\r\n",
      "brook with the kisses of the sun upon it. Rosamond thought that no one could be\r\n",
      "more in love than she was; and Lydgate thought that after all his wild mistakes\r\n",
      "and absurd credulity, he had found perfect womanhood—felt as if already\r\n",
      "breathed upon by exquisite wedded affection such as would be bestowed by an\r\n",
      "accomplished creature who venerated his high musings and momentous labors and\r\n",
      "would never interfere with them; who would create order in the home and\r\n",
      "accounts with still magic, yet keep her fingers ready to touch the lute and\r\n",
      "transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the true\r\n",
      "womanly limit and not a hair’s-breadth beyond—docile, therefore, and ready to\r\n",
      "carry out behests which came from that limit. It was plainer now than ever that\r\n",
      "his notion of remaining much longer a bachelor had been a mistake: marriage\r\n",
      "would not be an obstruction but a furtherance. And happening the next day to\r\n",
      "accompany a patient to Brassing, he saw a dinner-service there which struck him\r\n",
      "as so exactly the right thing that he bought it at once. It saved time to do\r\n",
      "these things just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.\r\n",
      "The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the nature\r\n",
      "of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but then it had to be\r\n",
      "done only once.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be lovely,” said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his purchase with\r\n",
      "some descriptive touches. “Just what Rosy ought to have. I trust in heaven it\r\n",
      "won’t be broken!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One must hire servants who will not break things,” said Lydgate. (Certainly,\r\n",
      "this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences. But at that period\r\n",
      "there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or less sanctioned by men of\r\n",
      "science.)\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma, who did\r\n",
      "not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a happy wife herself,\r\n",
      "had hardly any feeling but pride in her daughter’s marriage. But Rosamond had\r\n",
      "good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that papa should be appealed to in\r\n",
      "writing. She prepared for the arrival of the letter by walking with her papa to\r\n",
      "the warehouse the next morning, and telling him on the way that Mr. Lydgate\r\n",
      "wished to be married soon.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense, my dear!” said Mr. Vincy. “What has he got to marry on? You’d much\r\n",
      "better give up the engagement. I’ve told you so pretty plainly before this.\r\n",
      "What have you had such an education for, if you are to go and marry a poor man?\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said, “Well, well,\r\n",

      "certain that she had gained her point.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy’s answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should insure his\r\n",
      "life—a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully reassuring idea\r\n",
      "supposing that Lydgate died, but in the mean time not a self-supporting idea.\r\n",
      "However, it seemed to make everything comfortable about Rosamond’s marriage;\r\n",
      "and the necessary purchases went on with much spirit. Not without prudential\r\n",
      "considerations, however. A bride (who is going to visit at a baronet’s) must\r\n",
      "have a few first-rate pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary\r\n",
      "half-dozen, Rosamond contented herself without the very highest style of\r\n",
      "embroidery and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight\r\n",
      "hundred pounds had been considerably reduced since he had come to Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to\r\n",
      "him when he went into Kibble’s establishment at Brassing to buy forks and\r\n",
      "spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that Mr. Vincy would\r\n",
      "advance money to provide furniture; and though, since it would not be necessary\r\n",
      "to pay for everything at once, some bills would be left standing over, he did\r\n",
      "not waste time in conjecturing how much his father-in-law would give in the\r\n",
      "form of dowry, to make payment easy. He was not going to do anything\r\n",
      "extravagant, but the requisite things must be bought, and it would be bad\r\n",
      "economy to buy them of a poor quality. All these matters were by the bye.\r\n",
      "Lydgate foresaw that science and his profession were the objects he should\r\n",
      "alone pursue enthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them\r\n",
      "in such a home as Wrench had—the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the\r\n",
      "children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,\r\n",
      "black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched lymphatic\r\n",

      "“Do send him word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He will perhaps ask you\r\n",

      "\n",

      "curiously, as if he had been absent-minded. Mamma had a little filial lecture\r\n",

      "they would see many things in her own family which might shock them. Hence it\r\n",

      "done against another. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying\r\n",

      "over her—if he gave up everything else in life he would watch over her, and she\r\n",
      "should know that she had one slave in the world. Will had—to use Sir Thomas\r\n",
      "Browne’s phrase—a “passionate prodigality” of statement both to himself and\r\n",

      "Casaubon’s”). And though Will had not seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had\r\n",
      "been enough to restore her former sense of young companionship with one who was\r\n",
      "cleverer than herself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her. Poor Dorothea\r\n",
      "before her marriage had never found much room in other minds for what she cared\r\n",
      "most to say; and she had not, as we know, enjoyed her husband’s superior\r\n",

      "given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to him from his tender years, and\r\n",
      "sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient sects or personages had held similar\r\n",
      "ideas, as if there were too much of that sort in stock already; at other times\r\n",
      "he would inform her that she was mistaken, and reassert what her remark had\r\n",
      "questioned.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "beneficently by making the joy of another soul. Hence the mere chance of seeing\r\n",
      "Will occasionally was like a lunette opened in the wall of her prison, giving\r\n",
      "her a glimpse of the sunny air; and this pleasure began to nullify her original\r\n",
      "alarm at what her husband might think about the introduction of Will as her\r\n",
      "uncle’s guest. On this subject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow\r\n",
      "circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante and\r\n",
      "Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of things, and in\r\n",
      "later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and more conversation.\r\n",
      "Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was limited by the dread of\r\n",
      "offending Dorothea. He found out at last that he wanted to take a particular\r\n",
      "sketch at Lowick; and one morning when Mr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick\r\n",
      "road on his way to the county town, Will asked to be set down with his\r\n",
      "sketch-book and camp-stool at Lowick, and without announcing himself at the\r\n",
      "Manor settled himself to sketch in a position where he must see Dorothea if she\r\n",
      "came out to walk—and he knew that she usually walked an hour in the morning.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with treacherous\r\n",
      "quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take shelter in the\r\n",
      "house. He intended, on the strength of relationship, to go into the\r\n",
      "drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and seeing his old\r\n",
      "acquaintance the butler in the hall, he said, “Don’t mention that I am here,\r\n",

      "“Master is out, sir; there’s only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I’d better tell\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon’s,” she said, at once. “I don’t know\r\n",

      "dislikes interruption at this hour.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.” Dorothea uttered\r\n",

      "school.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "dress of some thin woollen-white material, without a single ornament on her\r\n",
      "besides her wedding-ring, as if she were under a vow to be different from all\r\n",
      "other women; and Will sat down opposite her at two yards’ distance, the light\r\n",
      "falling on his bright curls and delicate but rather petulant profile, with its\r\n",
      "defiant curves of lip and chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been\r\n",
      "two flowers which had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her\r\n",
      "husband’s mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at her\r\n",
      "thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she had found\r\n",
      "receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she exaggerated a past\r\n",
      "solace.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,” she said,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "feeling that he was in the presence of a creature worthy to be perfectly loved.\r\n",
      "I think his own feelings at that moment were perfect, for we mortals have our\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,” said Dorothea. “I\r\n",
      "can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand just a little Greek.\r\n",
      "I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find out references for him and save\r\n",
      "his eyes in many ways. But it is very difficult to be learned; it seems as if\r\n",
      "people were worn out on the way to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them\r\n",
      "because they are too tired.”\r\n",

      "certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he, and seeing her face change,\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You correct me,” said Dorothea. “I expressed myself ill. I should have said\r\n",
      "that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in working them out. I\r\n",
      "used to feel about that, even when I was a little girl; and it always seemed to\r\n",
      "me that the use I should like to make of my life would be to help some one who\r\n",
      "did great works, so that his burthen might be lighter.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of making a\r\n",
      "revelation. But she had never before said anything to Will which threw so\r\n",
      "strong a light on her marriage. He did not shrug his shoulders; and for want of\r\n",
      "that muscular outlet he thought the more irritably of beautiful lips kissing\r\n",
      "holy skulls and other emptinesses ecclesiastically enshrined. Also he had to\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you may easily carry the help too far,” he said, “and get over-wrought\r\n",
      "yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look paler. It would be\r\n",
      "better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he could easily get a man who\r\n",
      "would do half his work for him. It would save him more effectually, and you\r\n",
      "need only help him in lighter ways.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "There is no good to be done in Lowick. The only thing I desire is to help him\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr. Brooke and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Dorothea, “but they don’t understand—they want me to be a great\r\n",

      "up my days. I thought you could understand that one’s mind has other wants,”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“My mistake is excusable,” said Will. “In old days I used to hear Mr. Casaubon\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him to give another\r\n",
      "good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon’s glory, he went on, “And I\r\n",
      "have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any one to overlook his work\r\n",
      "and know thoroughly what he is doing. He is too doubtful—too uncertain of\r\n",

      "Will was not without his intentions to be always generous, but our tongues are\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dorothea was strangely quiet—not immediately indignant, as she had been on\r\n",
      "a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She was no longer struggling\r\n",
      "against the perception of facts, but adjusting herself to their clearest\r\n",
      "perception; and now when she looked steadily at her husband’s failure, still\r\n",
      "more at his possible consciousness of failure, she seemed to be looking along\r\n",

      "bread.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I knew all about her!” said Dorothea. “I wonder how she bore the change\r\n",
      "from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she was happy with her husband! Do you\r\n",
      "know much about them?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; only that my grandfather was a patriot—a bright fellow—could speak many\r\n",
      "languages—musical—got his bread by teaching all sorts of things. They both died\r\n",
      "rather early. And I never knew much of my father, beyond what my mother told\r\n",
      "me; but he inherited the musical talents. I remember his slow walk and his long\r\n",
      "thin hands; and one day remains with me when he was lying ill, and I was very\r\n",
      "hungry, and had only a little bit of bread.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, what a different life from mine!” said Dorothea, with keen interest,\r\n",
      "clasping her hands on her lap. “I have always had too much of everything. But\r\n",
      "tell me how it was—Mr. Casaubon could not have known about you then.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was my last\r\n",
      "hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I were well taken care\r\n",
      "of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it as his duty to take care of us\r\n",
      "because of the harsh injustice which had been shown to his mother’s sister. But\r\n",
      "now I am telling you what is not new to you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what was\r\n",
      "rather new even in his own construction of things—namely, that Mr. Casaubon had\r\n",
      "never done more than pay a debt towards him. Will was much too good a fellow to\r\n",
      "be easy under the sense of being ungrateful. And when gratitude has become a\r\n",
      "matter of reasoning there are many ways of escaping from its bonds.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” answered Dorothea; “Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on his own\r\n",
      "honorable actions.” She did not feel that her husband’s conduct was\r\n",
      "depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required in his relations with\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her mind. After a moment’s pause, she added,\r\n",
      "“He had never told me that he supported your mother. Is she still living?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; she died by an accident—a fall—four years ago. It is curious that my\r\n",
      "mother, too, ran away from her family, but not for the sake of her husband. She\r\n",
      "never would tell me anything about her family, except that she forsook them to\r\n",
      "get her own living—went on the stage, in fact. She was a dark-eyed creature,\r\n",
      "with crisp ringlets, and never seemed to be getting old. You see I come of\r\n",
      "rebellious blood on both sides,” Will ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea,\r\n",
      "while she was still looking with serious intentness before her, like a child\r\n",
      "seeing a drama for the first time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But her face, too, broke into a smile as she said, “That is your apology, I\r\n",
      "suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean, to Mr. Casaubon’s\r\n",
      "wishes. You must remember that you have not done what he thought best for you.\r\n",
      "And if he dislikes you—you were speaking of dislike a little while ago—but I\r\n",
      "should rather say, if he has shown any painful feelings towards you, you must\r\n",
      "consider how sensitive he has become from the wearing effect of study.\r\n",
      "Perhaps,” she continued, getting into a pleading tone, “my uncle has not told\r\n",
      "you how serious Mr. Casaubon’s illness was. It would be very petty of us who\r\n",
      "are well and can bear things, to think much of small offences from those who\r\n",
      "carry a weight of trial.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You teach me better,” said Will. “I will never grumble on that subject again.”\r\n",
      "There was a gentleness in his tone which came from the unutterable contentment\r\n",
      "of perceiving—what Dorothea was hardly conscious of—that she was travelling\r\n",
      "into the remoteness of pure pity and loyalty towards her husband. Will was\r\n",
      "ready to adore her pity and loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in\r\n",
      "manifesting them. “I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,” he went on,\r\n",
      "“but I will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would\r\n",
      "disapprove.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very good of you,” said Dorothea, with another open smile. “I shall\r\n",
      "have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you will soon go away,\r\n",
      "out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired of staying at the Grange.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is a point I wanted to mention to you—one of the reasons why I wished to\r\n",
      "speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay in this\r\n",
      "neighborhood. He has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he wishes me\r\n",
      "to conduct that, and also to help him in other ways.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?” said Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and not\r\n",
      "settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you would not\r\n",
      "like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would rather stay in this\r\n",
      "part of the country than go away. I belong to nobody anywhere else.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like you to stay very much,” said Dorothea, at once, as simply and\r\n",
      "readily as she had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow of a reason in her\r\n",
      "mind at the moment why she should not say so.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I will stay,” said Ladislaw, shaking his head backward, rising and\r\n",
      "going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting\r\n",
      "continually stronger, began to reflect that her husband felt differently from\r\n",
      "herself, and she colored deeply under the double embarrassment of having\r\n",
      "expressed what might be in opposition to her husband’s feeling, and of having\r\n",
      "to suggest this opposition to Will. His face was not turned towards her, and\r\n",
      "this made it easier to say—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think you should\r\n",
      "be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of anything else than my\r\n",
      "own feeling, which has nothing to do with the real question. But it now occurs\r\n",
      "to me—perhaps Mr. Casaubon might see that the proposal was not wise. Can you\r\n",
      "not wait now and mention it to him?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t wait to-day,” said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility that Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon would enter. “The rain is quite over now. I told Mr. Brooke not to\r\n",
      "call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I shall strike across Halsell\r\n",
      "Common, and see the gleams on the wet grass. I like that.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He approached her to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not daring to\r\n",
      "say, “Don’t mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.” No, he dared not, could not\r\n",
      "say it. To ask her to be less simple and direct would be like breathing on the\r\n",
      "crystal that you want to see the light through. And there was always the other\r\n",
      "great dread—of himself becoming dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her eyes.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you could have stayed,” said Dorothea, with a touch of mournfulness, as\r\n",
      "she rose and put out her hand. She also had her thought which she did not like\r\n",
      "to express:—Will certainly ought to lose no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon’s\r\n",
      "wishes, but for her to urge this might seem an undue dictation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they only said “Good-by,” and Will quitted the house, striking across the\r\n",
      "fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr. Casaubon’s carriage,\r\n",
      "which, however, did not appear at the gate until four o’clock. That was an\r\n",
      "unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too early to gain the moral support\r\n",
      "under ennui of dressing his person for dinner, and too late to undress his mind\r\n",
      "of the day’s frivolous ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good\r\n",
      "plunge into the serious business of study. On such occasions he usually threw\r\n",
      "into an easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London\r\n",
      "papers to him, closing his eyes the while. To-day, however, he declined that\r\n",
      "relief, observing that he had already had too many public details urged upon\r\n",
      "him; but he spoke more cheerfully than usual, when Dorothea asked about his\r\n",
      "fatigue, and added with that air of formal effort which never forsook him even\r\n",
      "when he spoke without his waistcoat and cravat—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr. Spanning,\r\n",
      "to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy recipient of\r\n",
      "praise. He spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on the Egyptian\r\n",
      "Mysteries,—using, in fact, terms which it would not become me to repeat.” In\r\n",
      "uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned over the elbow of his chair, and\r\n",
      "swayed his head up and down, apparently as a muscular outlet instead of that\r\n",
      "recapitulation which would not have been becoming.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very glad you have had that pleasure,” said Dorothea, delighted to see\r\n",
      "her husband less weary than usual at this hour. “Before you came I had been\r\n",
      "regretting that you happened to be out to-day.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why so, my dear?” said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he has mentioned a proposal of my\r\n",
      "uncle’s which I should like to know your opinion of.” Her husband she felt was\r\n",
      "really concerned in this question. Even with her ignorance of the world she had\r\n",
      "a vague impression that the position offered to Will was out of keeping with\r\n",
      "his family connections, and certainly Mr. Casaubon had a claim to be consulted.\r\n",
      "He did not speak, but merely bowed.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he has bought one of\r\n",
      "the Middlemarch newspapers, and he has asked Mr. Ladislaw to stay in this\r\n",
      "neighborhood and conduct the paper for him, besides helping him in other ways.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea looked at her husband while she spoke, but he had at first blinked and\r\n",
      "finally closed his eyes, as if to save them; while his lips became more tense.\r\n",
      "“What is your opinion?” she added, rather timidly, after a slight pause.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?” said Mr. Casaubon,\r\n",
      "opening his eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at Dorothea. She was really\r\n",
      "uncomfortable on the point he inquired about, but she only became a little more\r\n",
      "serious, and her eyes did not swerve.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” she answered immediately, “he did not say that he came to ask your\r\n",
      "opinion. But when he mentioned the proposal, he of course expected me to tell\r\n",
      "you of it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon was silent.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young man with so\r\n",
      "much talent might be very useful to my uncle—might help him to do good in a\r\n",
      "better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some fixed occupation. He has been\r\n",
      "blamed, he says, for not seeking something of that kind, and he would like to\r\n",
      "stay in this neighborhood because no one cares for him elsewhere.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her husband. However, he\r\n",
      "did not speak, and she presently recurred to Dr. Spanning and the Archdeacon’s\r\n",
      "breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on these subjects.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next morning, without Dorothea’s knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched the\r\n",
      "following letter, beginning “Dear Mr. Ladislaw” (he had always before addressed\r\n",
      "him as “Will”):—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and (according\r\n",
      "to an inference by no means stretched) has on your part been in some degree\r\n",
      "entertained, which involves your residence in this neighborhood in a capacity\r\n",
      "which I am justified in saying touches my own position in such a way as renders\r\n",
      "it not only natural and warrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the\r\n",
      "influence of legitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is\r\n",
      "considered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that your\r\n",
      "acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly offensive to me.\r\n",
      "That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto here, would not, I believe, be\r\n",
      "denied by any reasonable person cognizant of the relations between us:\r\n",
      "relations which, though thrown into the past by your recent procedure, are not\r\n",
      "thereby annulled in their character of determining antecedents. I will not here\r\n",
      "make reflections on any person’s judgment. It is enough for me to point out to\r\n",
      "yourself that there are certain social fitnesses and proprieties which should\r\n",
      "hinder a somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any wise conspicuous in\r\n",
      "this vicinity in a status not only much beneath my own, but associated at best\r\n",
      "with the sciolism of literary or political adventurers. At any rate, the\r\n",
      "contrary issue must exclude you from further reception at my house.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Dorothea’s mind was innocently at work towards the further\r\n",
      "embitterment of her husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to agitation,\r\n",
      "on what Will had told her about his parents and grandparents. Any private hours\r\n",
      "in her day were usually spent in her blue-green boudoir, and she had come to be\r\n",
      "very fond of its pallid quaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there;\r\n",
      "but while the summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the\r\n",
      "avenue of elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an\r\n",
      "inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels, the\r\n",
      "invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our spiritual falls.\r\n",
      "She had been so used to struggle for and to find resolve in looking along the\r\n",
      "avenue towards the arch of western light that the vision itself had gained a\r\n",
      "communicating power. Even the pale stag seemed to have reminding glances and to\r\n",
      "mean mutely, “Yes, we know.” And the group of delicately touched miniatures had\r\n",
      "made an audience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,\r\n",
      "but still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious “Aunt Julia” about whom\r\n",
      "Dorothea had never found it easy to question her husband.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, since her conversation with Will, many fresh images had gathered round\r\n",
      "that Aunt Julia who was Will’s grandmother; the presence of that delicate\r\n",
      "miniature, so like a living face that she knew, helping to concentrate her\r\n",
      "feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl from the family protection and\r\n",
      "inheritance only because she had chosen a man who was poor! Dorothea, early\r\n",
      "troubling her elders with questions about the facts around her, had wrought\r\n",
      "herself into some independent clearness as to the historical, political reasons\r\n",
      "why eldest sons had superior rights, and why land should be entailed: those\r\n",
      "reasons, impressing her with a certain awe, might be weightier than she knew,\r\n",
      "but here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed. Here was a\r\n",
      "daughter whose child—even according to the ordinary aping of aristocratic\r\n",
      "institutions by people who are no more aristocratic than retired grocers, and\r\n",
      "who have no more land to “keep together” than a lawn and a paddock—would have a\r\n",
      "prior claim. Was inheritance a question of liking or of responsibility? All the\r\n",
      "energy of Dorothea’s nature went on the side of responsibility—the fulfilment\r\n",
      "of claims founded on our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was true, she said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the\r\n",
      "Ladislaws—that he had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged of. And\r\n",
      "now she began to think of her husband’s will, which had been made at the time\r\n",
      "of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his property to her, with proviso in\r\n",
      "case of her having children. That ought to be altered; and no time ought to be\r\n",
      "lost. This very question which had just arisen about Will Ladislaw’s\r\n",
      "occupation, was the occasion for placing things on a new, right footing. Her\r\n",
      "husband, she felt sure, according to all his previous conduct, would be ready\r\n",
      "to take the just view, if she proposed it—she, in whose interest an unfair\r\n",
      "concentration of the property had been urged. His sense of right had surmounted\r\n",
      "and would continue to surmount anything that might be called antipathy. She\r\n",
      "suspected that her uncle’s scheme was disapproved by Mr. Casaubon, and this\r\n",
      "made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh understanding should be begun,\r\n",
      "so that instead of Will’s starting penniless and accepting the first function\r\n",
      "that offered itself, he should find himself in possession of a rightful income\r\n",
      "which should be paid by her husband during his life, and, by an immediate\r\n",
      "alteration of the will, should be secured at his death. The vision of all this\r\n",
      "as what ought to be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of\r\n",
      "daylight, waking her from her previous stupidity and incurious self-absorbed\r\n",
      "ignorance about her husband’s relation to others. Will Ladislaw had refused Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s future aid on a ground that no longer appeared right to her; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon had never himself seen fully what was the claim upon him. “But he\r\n",
      "will!” said Dorothea. “The great strength of his character lies here. And what\r\n",
      "are we doing with our money? We make no use of half of our income. My own money\r\n",
      "buys me nothing but an uneasy conscience.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of property\r\n",
      "intended for herself, and always regarded by her as excessive. She was blind,\r\n",
      "you see, to many things obvious to others—likely to tread in the wrong places,\r\n",
      "as Celia had warned her; yet her blindness to whatever did not lie in her own\r\n",
      "pure purpose carried her safely by the side of precipices where vision would\r\n",
      "have been perilous with fear.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her boudoir\r\n",
      "occupied her incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon had sent his\r\n",
      "letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her till she could find an\r\n",
      "opportunity of opening her heart to her husband. To his preoccupied mind all\r\n",
      "subjects were to be approached gently, and she had never since his illness lost\r\n",
      "from her consciousness the dread of agitating him. But when young ardor is set\r\n",
      "brooding over the conception of a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start\r\n",
      "forth with independent life, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a\r\n",
      "sombre fashion, not unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually silent;\r\n",
      "but there were hours of the night which might be counted on as opportunities of\r\n",
      "conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her husband’s sleeplessness, had\r\n",
      "established a habit of rising, lighting a candle, and reading him to sleep\r\n",
      "again. And this night she was from the beginning sleepless, excited by\r\n",
      "resolves. He slept as usual for a few hours, but she had risen softly and had\r\n",
      "sat in the darkness for nearly an hour before he said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you feel ill, dear?” was her first question, as she obeyed him.\r\n",

      "hardly get her to dine with us, since he had that fit.” Sir James ended with a\r\n",
      "look of pitying disgust, and Mrs. Cadwallader shrugged her shoulders as much as\r\n",
      "to say that she was not likely to see anything new in that direction.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor Casaubon!” the Rector said. “That was a nasty attack. I thought he looked\r\n",
      "shattered the other day at the Archdeacon’s.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In point of fact,” resumed Sir James, not choosing to dwell on “fits,” “Brooke\r\n",
      "doesn’t mean badly by his tenants or any one else, but he has got that way of\r\n",
      "paring and clipping at expenses.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s a blessing,” said Mrs. Cadwallader. “That helps him to find\r\n",
      "himself in a morning. He may not know his own opinions, but he does know his\r\n",
      "own pocket.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t believe a man is in pocket by stinginess on his land,” said Sir James.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, stinginess may be abused like other virtues: it will not do to keep one’s\r\n",
      "own pigs lean,” said Mrs. Cadwallader, who had risen to look out of the window.\r\n",
      "“But talk of an independent politician and he will appear.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! Brooke?” said her husband.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. Now, you ply him with the ‘Trumpet,’ Humphrey; and I will put the leeches\r\n",
      "on him. What will you do, Sir James?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is, I don’t like to begin about it with Brooke, in our mutual\r\n",
      "position; the whole thing is so unpleasant. I do wish people would behave like\r\n",
      "gentlemen,” said the good baronet, feeling that this was a simple and\r\n",
      "comprehensive programme for social well-being.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here you all are, eh?” said Mr. Brooke, shuffling round and shaking hands. “I\r\n",
      "was going up to the Hall by-and-by, Chettam. But it’s pleasant to find\r\n",
      "everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of things?—going on a little fast!\r\n",
      "It was true enough, what Lafitte said—‘Since yesterday, a century has passed\r\n",
      "away:’—they’re in the next century, you know, on the other side of the water.\r\n",
      "Going on faster than we are.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, yes,” said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. “Here is the ‘Trumpet’\r\n",
      "accusing you of lagging behind—did you see?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eh? no,” said Mr. Brooke, dropping his gloves into his hat and hastily\r\n",
      "adjusting his eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his hand,\r\n",
      "saying, with a smile in his eyes—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "who receives his own rents. They say he is the most retrogressive man in the\r\n",
      "county. I think you must have taught them that word in the ‘Pioneer.’”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that is Keck—an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now! Come,\r\n",
      "that’s capital. He thinks it means destructive: they want to make me out a\r\n",
      "destructive, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, with that cheerfulness which is\r\n",
      "usually sustained by an adversary’s ignorance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think he knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or two. If\r\n",
      "we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil sense of the\r\n",
      "word—we should say, he is one who would dub himself a reformer of our\r\n",
      "constitution, while every interest for which he is immediately responsible is\r\n",
      "going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot bear one rogue to be hanged, but\r\n",
      "does not mind five honest tenants being half-starved: a man who shrieks at\r\n",
      "corruption, and keeps his farms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten\r\n",
      "boroughs, and does not mind if every field on his farms has a rotten gate: a\r\n",
      "man very open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he would give any\r\n",
      "number of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own\r\n",
      "pockets: what he objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to help a\r\n",
      "tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather out at a\r\n",
      "tenant’s barn-door or make his house look a little less like an Irish\r\n",
      "cottier’s. But we all know the wag’s definition of a philanthropist: a man\r\n",
      "whose charity increases directly as the square of the distance. And so on.\r\n",
      "All the rest is to show what sort of legislator a philanthropist is likely to\r\n",
      "make,” ended the Rector, throwing down the paper, and clasping his hands at the\r\n",
      "back of his head, while he looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused\r\n",
      "neutrality.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s rather good, you know,” said Mr. Brooke, taking up the paper and\r\n",
      "trying to bear the attack as easily as his neighbor did, but coloring and\r\n",
      "smiling rather nervously; “that about roaring himself red at rotten boroughs—I\r\n",
      "never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my life. And as to roaring myself\r\n",
      "red and that kind of thing—these men never understand what is good satire.\r\n",
      "Satire, you know, should be true up to a certain point. I recollect they said\r\n",
      "that in ‘The Edinburgh’ somewhere—it must be true up to a certain point.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is really a hit about the gates,” said Sir James, anxious to tread\r\n",
      "carefully. “Dagley complained to me the other day that he hadn’t got a decent\r\n",
      "gate on his farm. Garth has invented a new pattern of gate—I wish you would try\r\n",
      "it. One ought to use some of one’s timber in that way.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, appearing to\r\n",
      "glance over the columns of the “Trumpet.” “That’s your hobby, and you don’t\r\n",
      "mind the expense.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for Parliament,”\r\n",
      "said Mrs. Cadwallader. “They said the last unsuccessful candidate at\r\n",
      "Middlemarch—Giles, wasn’t his name?—spent ten thousand pounds and failed\r\n",
      "because he did not bribe enough. What a bitter reflection for a man!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the kind,” said Mr. Brooke. “The Tories bribe, you know: Hawley and\r\n",
      "his set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of thing; and they\r\n",
      "bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not going to have it their own\r\n",
      "way in future—not in future, you know. Middlemarch is a little backward, I\r\n",
      "admit—the freemen are a little backward. But we shall educate them—we shall\r\n",
      "bring them on, you know. The best people there are on our side.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,” remarked Sir\r\n",
      "James. “He says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that if you got pelted,” interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, “half the rotten\r\n",
      "eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens! Think what it must\r\n",
      "be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to remember a story of a man\r\n",
      "they pretended to chair and let him fall into a dust-heap on purpose!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one’s coat,” said the Rector. “I\r\n",
      "confess that’s what I should be afraid of, if we parsons had to stand at the\r\n",
      "hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of their reckoning up all my\r\n",
      "fishing days. Upon my word, I think the truth is the hardest missile one can be\r\n",
      "pelted with.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is,” said Sir James, “if a man goes into public life he must be\r\n",
      "prepared for the consequences. He must make himself proof against calumny.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “But how\r\n",
      "will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read history—look at\r\n",
      "ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of thing. They always happen\r\n",
      "to the best men, you know. But what is that in Horace?—fiat justitia,\r\n",
      "ruat … something or other.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exactly,” said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. “What I mean by\r\n",
      "being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact as a\r\n",
      "contradiction.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one’s self,” said\r\n",
      "Mrs. Cadwallader.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was Sir James’s evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke. “Well,\r\n",
      "you know, Chettam,” he said, rising, taking up his hat and leaning on his\r\n",
      "stick, “you and I have a different system. You are all for outlay with your\r\n",
      "farms. I don’t want to make out that my system is good under all\r\n",
      "circumstances—under all circumstances, you know.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,” said Sir James.\r\n",
      "“Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair valuation. What do you\r\n",
      "say, Cadwallader?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the ‘Trumpet’ at once by\r\n",
      "getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving him carte\r\n",
      "blanche about gates and repairs: that’s my view of the political\r\n",
      "situation,” said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking his thumbs in his\r\n",
      "armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a showy sort of thing to do, you know,” said Mr. Brooke. “But I should\r\n",
      "like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his tenants for\r\n",
      "arrears as little as I have. I let the old tenants stay on. I’m uncommonly\r\n",
      "easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my own ideas, and I take my\r\n",
      "stand on them, you know. A man who does that is always charged with\r\n",
      "eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of thing. When I change my line of\r\n",
      "action, I shall follow my own ideas.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he had omitted\r\n",
      "to send off from the Grange, and he bade everybody hurriedly good-by.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t want to take a liberty with Brooke,” said Sir James; “I see he is\r\n",
      "nettled. But as to what he says about old tenants, in point of fact no new\r\n",
      "tenant would take the farms on the present terms.”\r\n",

      "“I have a notion that he will be brought round in time,” said the Rector. “But\r\n",
      "you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling another. You wanted to\r\n",
      "frighten him away from expense, and we want to frighten him into it. Better let\r\n",
      "him try to be popular and see that his character as a landlord stands in his\r\n",
      "way. I don’t think it signifies two straws about the ‘Pioneer,’ or Ladislaw, or\r\n",
      "Brooke’s speechifying to the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the\r\n",

      "we should all have pulled together. If you put him a-horseback on politics, I\r\n",

      "epic written with Homeric particularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he\r\n",
      "started up as from an electric shock, and felt a tingling at his finger-ends.\r\n",
      "Any one observing him would have seen a change in his complexion, in the\r\n",

      "passion for another as joy in the morning light over valley and river and white\r\n",

      "darkness; and she was anew smitten with hopelessness that she could influence\r\n",
      "Mr. Casaubon’s action. But the marked expression of her sorrow convinced Will\r\n",
      "that it was not all given to him personally, and that Dorothea had not been\r\n",
      "visited by the idea that Mr. Casaubon’s dislike and jealousy of him turned upon\r\n",

      "suspicion and without stint—of vexation because he was of too little account\r\n",
      "with her, was not formidable enough, was treated with an unhesitating\r\n",
      "benevolence which did not flatter him. But his dread of any change in Dorothea\r\n",

      "give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to expect that my course\r\n",

      "entreatingly. “You will say it is Persian, or something else geographical. It\r\n",
      "is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part with it. I have always been\r\n",
      "finding out my religion since I was a little girl. I used to pray so much—now I\r\n",
      "hardly ever pray. I try not to have desires merely for myself, because they may\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,” said Will. “But I am a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don’t feel as if I were\r\n",

      "into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley’s, to speak about the\r\n",
      "small delinquent who had been caught with the leveret. Dorothea renewed the\r\n",
      "subject of the estate as they drove along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken\r\n",
      "unawares, got the talk under his own control.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "“Chettam, now,” he replied; “he finds fault with me, my dear; but I should not\r\n",
      "preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he can’t say that that expense\r\n",
      "is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It’s a little against my\r\n",
      "feeling:—poaching, now, if you come to look into it—I have often thought of\r\n",
      "getting up the subject. Not long ago, Flavell, the Methodist preacher, was\r\n",
      "brought up for knocking down a hare that came across his path when he and his\r\n",
      "wife were walking out together. He was pretty quick, and knocked it on the\r\n",
      "neck.”\r\n",

      "“Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist preacher,\r\n",
      "you know. And Johnson said, ‘You may judge what a hypocrite he is.’ And\r\n",
      "upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very little like ‘the highest style of\r\n",

      "Young? Well, now, Flavell in his shabby black gaiters, pleading that he thought\r\n",
      "the Lord had sent him and his wife a good dinner, and he had a right to knock\r\n",
      "it down, though not a mighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was—I assure you\r\n",
      "it was rather comic: Fielding would have made something of it—or Scott,\r\n",
      "now—Scott might have worked it up. But really, when I came to think of it, I\r\n",
      "couldn’t help liking that the fellow should have a bit of hare to say grace\r\n",
      "over. It’s all a matter of prejudice—prejudice with the law on its side, you\r\n",
      "know—about the stick and the gaiters, and so on. However, it doesn’t do to\r\n",
      "reason about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson to be quiet, and I\r\n",
      "hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would not have been more severe,\r\n",

      "Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is wonderful\r\n",
      "how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we are blamed for\r\n",
      "them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to change their aspect for us\r\n",
      "after we have heard some frank remark on their less admirable points; and on\r\n",

      "the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked with ivy, the large porch\r\n",
      "was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and half the windows were closed with\r\n",
      "gray worm-eaten shutters about which the jasmine-boughs grew in wild\r\n",
      "luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall with hollyhocks peeping over it was a\r\n",
      "perfect study of highly mingled subdued color, and there was an aged goat (kept\r\n",
      "doubtless on interesting superstitious grounds) lying against the open\r\n",
      "back-kitchen door. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray\r\n",
      "barn-doors, the pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished\r\n",
      "unloading a wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the scanty\r\n",
      "dairy of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of the shed in\r\n",
      "brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to wander about the\r\n",
      "uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from feeding on a too meagre quality\r\n",
      "of rinsings,—all these objects under the quiet light of a sky marbled with high\r\n",
      "clouds would have made a sort of picture which we have all paused over as a\r\n",
      "“charming bit,” touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by\r\n",
      "the depression of the agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming\r\n",
      "capital, as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these\r\n",
      "troublesome associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke, and\r\n",
      "spoiled the scene for him. Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the landscape,\r\n",
      "carrying a pitchfork and wearing his milking-hat—a very old beaver flattened in\r\n",
      "front. His coat and breeches were the best he had, and he would not have been\r\n",
      "wearing them on this weekday occasion if he had not been to market and returned\r\n",
      "later than usual, having given himself the rare treat of dining at the public\r\n",
      "table of the Blue Bull. How he came to fall into this extravagance would\r\n",
      "perhaps be matter of wonderment to himself on the morrow; but before dinner\r\n",
      "something in the state of the country, a slight pause in the harvest before the\r\n",
      "Far Dips were cut, the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on\r\n",
      "the walls, had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim about\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should have good\r\n",
      "drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale well followed up by\r\n",
      "rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in them that they were not false\r\n",
      "enough to make poor Dagley seem merry: they only made his discontent less\r\n",
      "tongue-tied than usual. He had also taken too much in the shape of muddy\r\n",
      "political talk, a stimulant dangerously disturbing to his farming conservatism,\r\n",
      "which consisted in holding that whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely\r\n",
      "to be worse. He was flushed, and his eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as\r\n",

      "“Oh, ay, I’m a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,” said Dagley, with a\r\n",

      "by a little joyous laugh as he turned back to the beginning of the letter, and\r\n",

      "Garth would be disposed at the same time to resume the agency of the Tipton\r\n",
      "property. The Baronet added in very obliging words that he himself was\r\n",
      "particularly desirous of seeing the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same\r\n",
      "management, and he hoped to be able to show that the double agency might be\r\n",

      "her chin on his head. “Brooke didn’t like to ask me himself, I can see,” he\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here is an honor to your father, children,” said Mrs. Garth, looking round at\r\n",
      "the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents. “He is asked to take a post\r\n",
      "again by those who dismissed him long ago. That shows that he did his work\r\n",

      "to suppose anything else of him. “It’ll come to between four and five hundred,\r\n",
      "the two together.” Then with a little start of remembrance he said, “Mary,\r\n",
      "write and give up that school. Stay and help your mother. I’m as pleased as\r\n",
      "Punch, now I’ve thought of that.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than Caleb’s, but\r\n",
      "his talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he was very particular about\r\n",
      "his letter-writing, and regarded his wife as a treasury of correct language.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the cambric\r\n",
      "embroidery towards her mother entreatingly, that it might be put out of reach\r\n",
      "while the boys dragged her into a dance. Mrs. Garth, in placid joy, began to\r\n",
      "put the cups and plates together, while Caleb pushing his chair from the table,\r\n",
      "as if he were going to move to the desk, still sat holding his letters in his\r\n",
      "hand and looking on the ground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his\r\n",
      "left hand, according to a mute language of his own. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a thousand pities Christy didn’t take to business, Susan. I shall want\r\n",
      "help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the engineering—I’ve made up my mind\r\n",
      "to that.” He fell into meditation and finger-rhetoric again for a little while,\r\n",
      "and then continued: “I shall make Brooke have new agreements with the tenants,\r\n",
      "and I shall draw up a rotation of crops. And I’ll lay a wager we can get fine\r\n",
      "bricks out of the clay at Bott’s corner. I must look into that: it would\r\n",
      "cheapen the repairs. It’s a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family\r\n",
      "would be glad to do it for nothing.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mind you don’t, though,” said his wife, lifting up her finger.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no; but it’s a fine thing to come to a man when he’s seen into the nature\r\n",
      "of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country into good\r\n",
      "fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with their farming, and\r\n",
      "getting a bit of good contriving and solid building done—that those who are\r\n",
      "living and those who come after will be the better for. I’d sooner have it than\r\n",
      "a fortune. I hold it the most honorable work that is.” Here Caleb laid down his\r\n",
      "letters, thrust his fingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, and sat\r\n",
      "upright, but presently proceeded with some awe in his voice and moving his head\r\n",
      "slowly aside—“It’s a great gift of God, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That it is, Caleb,” said his wife, with answering fervor. “And it will be a\r\n",
      "blessing to your children to have had a father who did such work: a father\r\n",
      "whose good work remains though his name may be forgotten.” She could not say\r\n",
      "any more to him then about the pay.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his day’s work, was seated in\r\n",
      "silence with his pocket-book open on his knee, while Mrs. Garth and Mary were\r\n",
      "at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was whispering a dialogue with her doll,\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother came up the orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and\r\n",
      "shadows with the tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he was\r\n",
      "fond of his parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to\r\n",
      "Lydgate. He used to the full the clergyman’s privilege of disregarding the\r\n",
      "Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his mother that Mrs. Garth\r\n",
      "was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still, you see, he spent his\r\n",
      "evenings at the Vincys’, where the matron, though less of a lady, presided over\r\n",
      "a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In those days human intercourse was not\r\n",
      "determined solely by respect. But the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths,\r\n",
      "and a visit from him was no surprise to that family. Nevertheless he accounted\r\n",
      "for it even while he was shaking hands, by saying, “I come as an envoy, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth: I have something to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The\r\n",
      "fact is, poor fellow,” he continued, as he seated himself and looked round with\r\n",
      "his bright glance at the three who were listening to him, “he has taken me into\r\n",
      "his confidence.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary’s heart beat rather quickly: she wondered how far Fred’s confidence had\r\n",
      "gone.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We haven’t seen the lad for months,” said Caleb. “I couldn’t think what was\r\n",
      "become of him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has been away on a visit,” said the Vicar, “because home was a little too\r\n",
      "hot for him, and Lydgate told his mother that the poor fellow must not begin to\r\n",
      "study yet. But yesterday he came and poured himself out to me. I am very glad\r\n",
      "he did, because I have seen him grow up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am\r\n",
      "so much at home in the house that the children are like nephews and nieces to\r\n",
      "me. But it is a difficult case to advise upon. However, he has asked me to come\r\n",
      "and tell you that he is going away, and that he is so miserable about his debt\r\n",
      "to you, and his inability to pay, that he can’t bear to come himself even to\r\n",
      "bid you good by.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell him it doesn’t signify a farthing,” said Caleb, waving his hand. “We’ve\r\n",
      "had the pinch and have got over it. And now I’m going to be as rich as a Jew.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which means,” said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, “that we are going to\r\n",
      "have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at home.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the treasure-trove?” said Mr. Farebrother.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and perhaps for a\r\n",
      "pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it’s all the same family\r\n",
      "connection, and employment spreads like water if it’s once set going. It makes\r\n",
      "me very happy, Mr. Farebrother”—here Caleb threw back his head a little, and\r\n",
      "spread his arms on the elbows of his chair—“that I’ve got an opportunity again\r\n",
      "with the letting of the land, and carrying out a notion or two with\r\n",
      "improvements. It’s a most uncommonly cramping thing, as I’ve often told Susan,\r\n",
      "to sit on horseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be\r\n",
      "able to put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into\r\n",
      "politics I can’t think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement over only\r\n",
      "a few hundred acres.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his happiness had\r\n",
      "the effect of mountain air: his eyes were bright, and the words came without\r\n",
      "effort.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I congratulate you heartily, Garth,” said the Vicar. “This is the best sort of\r\n",
      "news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he dwelt a good deal on the\r\n",
      "injury he had done you in causing you to part with money—robbing you of it, he\r\n",
      "said—which you wanted for other purposes. I wish Fred were not such an idle\r\n",
      "dog; he has some very good points, and his father is a little hard upon him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is he going?” said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He means to try again for his degree, and he is going up to study before term.\r\n",
      "I have advised him to do that. I don’t urge him to enter the Church—on the\r\n",
      "contrary. But if he will go and work so as to pass, that will be some guarantee\r\n",
      "that he has energy and a will; and he is quite at sea; he doesn’t know what\r\n",

      "probably something more between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old\r\n",
      "playfellows, and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not\r\n",
      "a great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to this\r\n",
      "was the first shrug. Then he laughed at himself for being likely to have felt\r\n",
      "jealous, as if he had been a man able to marry, which, added he, it is as clear\r\n",

      "against them both than he had ever known before. Dorothea’s outpouring of her\r\n",
      "notions about money, in the darkness of the night, had done nothing but bring a\r\n",

      "work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and there might still be twenty\r\n",
      "years of achievement before him, which would justify the thirty years of\r\n",
      "preparation. That prospect was made the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance\r\n",
      "against the hasty sneers of Carp & Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was\r\n",
      "carrying his taper among the tombs of the past, those modern figures came\r\n",
      "athwart the dim light, and interrupted his diligent exploration. To convince\r\n",
      "Carp of his mistake, so that he would have to eat his own words with a good\r\n",
      "deal of indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,\r\n",
      "which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all eternity in\r\n",
      "heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus, the prevision of his\r\n",

      "little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted across the isles of sunlight, stole\r\n",
      "along in silence as in the presence of a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the\r\n",
      "first time found himself looking into the eyes of death—who was passing through\r\n",
      "one of those rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a\r\n",
      "commonplace, which is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision\r\n",
      "of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water\r\n",
      "which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the commonplace “We must\r\n",

      "calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of self-assertion. What\r\n",

      "her young hope which she should never find again. And just as clearly in the\r\n",
      "miserable light she saw her own and her husband’s solitude—how they walked\r\n",

      "overthrown. Was it her fault that she had believed in him—had believed in his\r\n",

      "who waited on his glances with trembling, and shut her best soul in prison,\r\n",

      "servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a sort of\r\n",
      "contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the different ranks\r\n",
      "were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us exactly what stuff it was\r\n",
      "that Dorothea wore in those days of mild autumn—that thin white woollen stuff\r\n",
      "soft to the touch and soft to the eye. It always seemed to have been lately\r\n",
      "washed, and to smell of the sweet hedges—was always in the shape of a pelisse\r\n",
      "with sleeves hanging all out of the fashion. Yet if she had entered before a\r\n",
      "still audience as Imogene or Cato’s daughter, the dress might have seemed right\r\n",
      "enough: the grace and dignity were in her limbs and neck; and about her simply\r\n",
      "parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then in the fate of\r\n",
      "women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold trencher we call a\r\n",
      "halo. By the present audience of two persons, no dramatic heroine could have\r\n",
      "been expected with more interest than Mrs. Casaubon. To Rosamond she was one of\r\n",
      "those county divinities not mixing with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest\r\n",
      "marks of manner or appearance were worthy of her study; moreover, Rosamond was\r\n",
      "not without satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of\r\n",
      "studying her. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by\r\n",
      "the best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at Sir\r\n",
      "Godwin Lydgate’s, she felt quite confident of the impression she must make on\r\n",
      "people of good birth. Dorothea put out her hand with her usual simple kindness,\r\n",
      "and looked admiringly at Lydgate’s lovely bride—aware that there was a\r\n",
      "gentleman standing at a distance, but seeing him merely as a coated figure at a\r\n",
      "wide angle. The gentleman was too much occupied with the presence of the one\r\n",
      "woman to reflect on the contrast between the two—a contrast that would\r\n",
      "certainly have been striking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their\r\n",
      "eyes were on a level; but imagine Rosamond’s infantine blondness and wondrous\r\n",
      "crown of hair-plaits, with her pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so perfect\r\n",
      "that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large embroidered collar\r\n",
      "which it was to be hoped all beholders would know the price of, her small hands\r\n",
      "duly set off with rings, and that controlled self-consciousness of manner which\r\n",
      "is the expensive substitute for simplicity.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "immediately. “I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I go home,\r\n",
      "and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find him, or even\r\n",
      "allow me to wait for him, if you expect him soon.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is at the New Hospital,” said Rosamond; “I am not sure how soon he will\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you let me go and fetch him?” said Will Ladislaw, coming forward. He had\r\n",
      "already taken up his hat before Dorothea entered. She colored with surprise,\r\n",
      "but put out her hand with a smile of unmistakable pleasure, saying—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It would be quicker to send the carriage for him,” said Dorothea, “if you will\r\n",
      "be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an instant\r\n",
      "over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, “I will go myself, thank\r\n",
      "you. I wish to lose no time before getting home again. I will drive to the\r\n",
      "Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate. I am very\r\n",
      "much obliged to you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she left the room\r\n",
      "hardly conscious of what was immediately around her—hardly conscious that Will\r\n",
      "opened the door for her and offered her his arm to lead her to the carriage.\r\n",
      "She took the arm but said nothing. Will was feeling rather vexed and miserable,\r\n",
      "and found nothing to say on his side. He handed her into the carriage in\r\n",
      "silence, they said good-by, and Dorothea drove away.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the five minutes’ drive to the Hospital she had time for some reflections\r\n",
      "that were quite new to her. Her decision to go, and her preoccupation in\r\n",
      "leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that there would be a sort of\r\n",
      "deception in her voluntarily allowing any further intercourse between herself\r\n",
      "and Will which she was unable to mention to her husband, and already her errand\r\n",
      "in seeking Lydgate was a matter of concealment. That was all that had been\r\n",
      "explicitly in her mind; but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now\r\n",
      "that she was alone in her drive, she heard the notes of the man’s voice and the\r\n",
      "accompanying piano, which she had not noted much at the time, returning on her\r\n",
      "inward sense; and she found herself thinking with some wonder that Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw was passing his time with Mrs. Lydgate in her husband’s absence. And\r\n",
      "then she could not help remembering that he had passed some time with her under\r\n",
      "like circumstances, so why should there be any unfitness in the fact? But Will\r\n",
      "was Mr. Casaubon’s relative, and one towards whom she was bound to show\r\n",
      "kindness. Still there had been signs which perhaps she ought to have understood\r\n",
      "as implying that Mr. Casaubon did not like his cousin’s visits during his own\r\n",
      "absence. “Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,” said poor Dorothea to\r\n",
      "herself, while the tears came rolling and she had to dry them quickly. She felt\r\n",
      "confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so clear to her before\r\n",
      "was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped at the gate of the Hospital.\r\n",
      "She was soon walking round the grass plots with Lydgate, and her feelings\r\n",
      "recovered the strong bent which had made her seek for this interview.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it clearly\r\n",
      "enough. His chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here for the first time\r\n",
      "there had come a chance which had set him at a disadvantage. It was not only,\r\n",
      "as it had been hitherto, that she was not supremely occupied with him, but that\r\n",
      "she had seen him under circumstances in which he might appear not to be\r\n",
      "supremely occupied with her. He felt thrust to a new distance from her, amongst\r\n",
      "the circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her life. But that was not\r\n",
      "his fault: of course, since he had taken his lodgings in the town, he had been\r\n",
      "making as many acquaintances as he could, his position requiring that he should\r\n",
      "know everybody and everything. Lydgate was really better worth knowing than any\r\n",
      "one else in the neighborhood, and he happened to have a wife who was musical\r\n",
      "and altogether worth calling upon. Here was the whole history of the situation\r\n",
      "in which Diana had descended too unexpectedly on her worshipper. It was\r\n",
      "mortifying. Will was conscious that he should not have been at Middlemarch but\r\n",
      "for Dorothea; and yet his position there was threatening to divide him from her\r\n",
      "with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to the\r\n",
      "persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome and Britain.\r\n",
      "Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy in the form of a\r\n",
      "tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices, like odorous bodies, have\r\n",
      "a double existence both solid and subtle—solid as the pyramids, subtle as the\r\n",
      "twentieth echo of an echo, or as the memory of hyacinths which once scented the\r\n",
      "darkness. And Will was of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of\r\n",
      "subtleties: a man of clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he did, that\r\n",
      "for the first time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him had\r\n",
      "sprung up in Dorothea’s mind, and that their silence, as he conducted her to\r\n",
      "the carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his hatred and\r\n",
      "jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid below her socially.\r\n",
      "Confound Casaubon!\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his hat, and looking irritated as he\r\n",
      "advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself at her work-table, said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come another day\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be happy to be taught,” said Rosamond. “But I am sure you admit that\r\n",
      "the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy your acquaintance with\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really, I never thought about it,” said Will, sulkily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him if she were\r\n",

      "Casaubon?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Herself,” said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs. Lydgate.\r\n",

      "conscious of her presence.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,” said Rosamond, dimpling, and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs. Casaubon\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her, I suppose.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, almost pettishly. “Worship is usually a matter of theory\r\n",
      "rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just at this moment—I\r\n",
      "must really tear myself away.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "slip an opportunity of furthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know whether your or Mr. Casaubon’s attention has been drawn to the\r\n",
      "needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem rather egotistic in\r\n",
      "me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault: it is because there is a\r\n",
      "fight being made against it by the other medical men. I think you are generally\r\n",
      "interested in such things, for I remember that when I first had the pleasure of\r\n",
      "seeing you at Tipton Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some\r\n",

      "miserable housing.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” said Dorothea, brightening. “I shall be quite grateful to you if\r\n",
      "you will tell me how I can help to make things a little better. Everything of\r\n",
      "that sort has slipped away from me since I have been married. I mean,” she\r\n",
      "said, after a moment’s hesitation, “that the people in our village are\r\n",
      "tolerably comfortable, and my mind has been too much taken up for me to inquire\r\n",

      "be done.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is everything to be done,” said Lydgate, with abrupt energy. “And this\r\n",
      "Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr. Bulstrode’s exertions,\r\n",
      "and in a great degree to his money. But one man can’t do everything in a scheme\r\n",
      "of this sort. Of course he looked forward to help. And now there’s a mean,\r\n",
      "petty feud set up against the thing in the town, by certain persons who want to\r\n",
      "make it a failure.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can be their reasons?” said Dorothea, with naive surprise.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode’s unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town would\r\n",
      "almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him. In this stupid world most\r\n",
      "people never consider that a thing is good to be done unless it is done by\r\n",
      "their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode before I came here. I look at\r\n",
      "him quite impartially, and I see that he has some notions—that he has set\r\n",
      "things on foot—which I can turn to good public purpose. If a fair number of the\r\n",
      "better educated men went to work with the belief that their observations might\r\n",
      "contribute to the reform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a\r\n",
      "change for the better. That’s my point of view. I hold that by refusing to work\r\n",
      "with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity of making my\r\n",
      "profession more generally serviceable.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I quite agree with you,” said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the situation\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him:—he is\r\n",
      "masterful and rather unsociable, and he is concerned with trade, which has\r\n",
      "complaints of its own that I know nothing about. But what has that to do with\r\n",
      "the question whether it would not be a fine thing to establish here a more\r\n",
      "valuable hospital than any they have in the county? The immediate motive to the\r\n",
      "opposition, however, is the fact that Bulstrode has put the medical direction\r\n",
      "into my hands. Of course I am glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing\r\n",
      "some good work,—and I am aware that I have to justify his choice of me. But the\r\n",
      "consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set themselves\r\n",

      "not otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.\r\n",

      "trash talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it\r\n",

      "rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal\r\n",
      "qualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not clearly\r\n",
      "distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for being of the\r\n",

      "votes in the ratio of their contributions, the Board itself filling up any\r\n",

      "It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted with nominees of the\r\n",

      "interest he had established in her mind might turn into acceptance of him as a\r\n",
      "husband—had no tempting, arresting power over him; he did not live in the\r\n",
      "scenery of such an event, and follow it out, as we all do with that imagined\r\n",
      "“otherwise” which is our practical heaven. It was not only that he was\r\n",
      "unwilling to entertain thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was\r\n",
      "already uneasy in the sense that he had to justify himself from the charge of\r\n",
      "ingratitude—the latent consciousness of many other barriers between himself and\r\n",
      "Dorothea besides the existence of her husband, had helped to turn away his\r\n",
      "imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr. Casaubon. And there were\r\n",
      "yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not bear the thought of any flaw\r\n",
      "appearing in his crystal: he was at once exasperated and delighted by the calm\r\n",
      "freedom with which Dorothea looked at him and spoke to him, and there was\r\n",
      "something so exquisite in thinking of her just as she was, that he could not\r\n",
      "long for a change which must somehow change her. Do we not shun the street\r\n",
      "version of a fine melody?—or shrink from the news that the rarity—some bit of\r\n",
      "chiselling or engraving perhaps—which we have dwelt on even with exultation in\r\n",
      "the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is really not an uncommon\r\n",
      "thing, and may be obtained as an every-day possession? Our good depends on the\r\n",

      "for what are called the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler\r\n",
      "influences, to have within him such a feeling as he had towards Dorothea, was\r\n",
      "like the inheritance of a fortune. What others might have called the futility\r\n",
      "of his passion, made an additional delight for his imagination: he was\r\n",
      "conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his own experience that\r\n",
      "higher love-poetry which had charmed his fancy. Dorothea, he said to himself,\r\n",
      "was forever enthroned in his soul: no other woman could sit higher than her\r\n",
      "footstool; and if he could have written out in immortal syllables the effect\r\n",

      "of her reach. He saw no creature among her friends to whom he could believe\r\n",
      "that she spoke with the same simple confidence as to him. She had once said\r\n",

      "demonstration that his public exertions with Mr. Brooke as a chief could not\r\n",

      "effort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what her\r\n",

      "family property, by her being convinced that she was in the right and her\r\n",
      "husband in the wrong, but that she was helpless. This afternoon the\r\n",
      "helplessness was more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she longed for objects\r\n",

      "not insist, and she read for an hour or more on the same plan as she had done\r\n",
      "in the evening, but getting over the pages with more quickness. Mr. Casaubon’s\r\n",
      "mind was more alert, and he seemed to anticipate what was coming after a very\r\n",
      "slight verbal indication, saying, “That will do—mark that”—or “Pass on to the\r\n",

      "While she constrained herself to lie still lest she should disturb him, her\r\n",
      "mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination ranged its forces first on\r\n",
      "one side and then on the other. She had no presentiment that the power which\r\n",
      "her husband wished to establish over her future action had relation to anything\r\n",
      "else than his work. But it was clear enough to her that he would expect her to\r\n",
      "devote herself to sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the\r\n",
      "doubtful illustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had\r\n",
      "become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key which had\r\n",

      "that, in spite of her small instruction, her judgment in this matter was truer\r\n",
      "than his: for she looked with unbiassed comparison and healthy sense at\r\n",
      "probabilities on which he had risked all his egoism. And now she pictured to\r\n",
      "herself the days, and months, and years which she must spend in sorting what\r\n",
      "might be called shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was\r\n",
      "itself a mosaic wrought from crushed ruins—sorting them as food for a theory\r\n",
      "which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless a\r\n",
      "vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth a-breathing:\r\n",
      "the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of substances, the body\r\n",
      "of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and Lavoisier is born. But Mr.\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s theory of the elements which made the seed of all tradition was not\r\n",
      "likely to bruise itself unawares against discoveries: it floated among flexible\r\n",
      "conjectures no more solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of\r\n",
      "likeness in sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them\r\n",
      "impossible: it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the\r\n",
      "necessity of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate\r\n",
      "notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for\r\n",
      "threading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check her\r\n",
      "weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as it revealed\r\n",
      "itself to her instead of the fellowship in high knowledge which was to make\r\n",
      "life worthier! She could understand well enough now why her husband had come to\r\n",
      "cling to her, as possibly the only hope left that his labors would ever take a\r\n",
      "shape in which they could be given to the world. At first it had seemed that he\r\n",
      "wished to keep even her aloof from any close knowledge of what he was doing;\r\n",
      "but gradually the terrible stringency of human need—the prospect of a too\r\n",
      "speedy death—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And here Dorothea’s pity turned from her own future to her husband’s past—nay,\r\n",
      "to his present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out of that past: the\r\n",
      "lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the pressure of\r\n",
      "self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs; and now at last the\r\n",
      "sword visibly trembling above him! And had she not wished to marry him that she\r\n",
      "might help him in his life’s labor?—But she had thought the work was to be\r\n",
      "something greater, which she could serve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it\r\n",
      "right, even to soothe his grief—would it be possible, even if she promised—to\r\n",
      "work as in a treadmill fruitlessly?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet, could she deny him? Could she say, “I refuse to content this pining\r\n",

      "nothing that she would not still be free to remonstrate against, and even to\r\n",
      "refuse. But—the thought passed through her mind more than once, though she\r\n",
      "could not believe in it—might he not mean to demand something more from her\r\n",
      "than she had been able to imagine, since he wanted her pledge to carry out his\r\n",
      "wishes without telling her exactly what they were? No; his heart was bound up\r\n",
      "in his work only: that was the end for which his failing life was to be eked\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And now, if she were to say, “No! if you die, I will put no finger to your\r\n",

      "of trees, hesitating, as she had done once before, though from a different\r\n",
      "cause. Then she had feared lest her effort at fellowship should be unwelcome;\r\n",

      "to a fellowship from which she shrank. Neither law nor the world’s opinion\r\n",
      "compelled her to this—only her husband’s nature and her own compassion, only\r\n",

      "situation, yet she was fettered: she could not smite the stricken soul that\r\n",
      "entreated hers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But the half-hour was\r\n",
      "passing, and she must not delay longer. When she entered the Yew-tree Walk she\r\n",
      "could not see her husband; but the walk had bends, and she went, expecting to\r\n",
      "catch sight of his figure wrapped in a blue cloak, which, with a warm velvet\r\n",
      "cap, was his outer garment on chill days for the garden. It occurred to her\r\n",
      "that he might be resting in the summer-house, towards which the path diverged a\r\n",
      "little. Turning the angle, she could see him seated on the bench, close to a\r\n",
      "stone table. His arms were resting on the table, and his brow was bowed down on\r\n",
      "them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening his face on each side.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "But then she remembered that of late she had seen him take that attitude when\r\n",
      "she was reading to him, as if he found it easier than any other; and that he\r\n",
      "would sometimes speak, as well as listen, with his face down in that way. She\r\n",
      "went into the summerhouse and said, “I am come, Edward; I am ready.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took no notice, and she thought that he must be fast asleep. She laid her\r\n",
      "hand on his shoulder, and repeated, “I am ready!” Still he was motionless; and\r\n",
      "with a sudden confused fear, she leaned down to him, took off his velvet cap,\r\n",
      "and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying in a distressed tone—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her bedside, and she was talking\r\n",
      "deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone through her mind the\r\n",
      "night before. She knew him, and called him by his name, but appeared to think\r\n",
      "it right that she should explain everything to him; and again, and again,\r\n",

      "becoming acute about the truths that lay on the side of his own wishes. “I\r\n",
      "might get rid of Ladislaw up to a certain point—take away the ‘Pioneer’ from\r\n",

      "“I should like to have fuller knowledge about him, uncle, and judge for myself,\r\n",

      "some addition to his will—there may be some instructions for me,” said\r\n",

      "now—it’s a crisis—a political crisis, you know. And here is Celia and her\r\n",
      "little man—you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a sort of grandfather,”\r\n",
      "said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to get away and tell Chettam that\r\n",
      "it would not be his (Mr. Brooke’s) fault if Dorothea insisted on looking into\r\n",
      "everything.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What? why, his upper lip; see how he is drawing it down, as if he meant to\r\n",

      "were here. Do look at him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down Dorothea’s\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am sure you\r\n",
      "did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be happy now.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not said so yet\r\n",
      "(here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the gallery). Besides, you\r\n",
      "have got a wrong notion in your head as usual, Dodo—I can see that: it vexes\r\n",
      "me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost ready\r\n",
      "now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering with some fear\r\n",
      "what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and was determined to use\r\n",
      "it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or knew how to manage her. Since\r\n",
      "Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new sense of her mental solidity and calm\r\n",
      "wisdom. It seemed clear that where there was a baby, things were right enough,\r\n",
      "and that error, in general, was a mere lack of that central poising force.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said Celia. “You\r\n",
      "are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable for you to do now,\r\n",
      "only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had not been uncomfortable\r\n",
      "enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and you will find that out. He has\r\n",
      "behaved very badly. James is as angry with him as can be. And I had better tell\r\n",
      "you, to prepare you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once what\r\n",
      "you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left the property\r\n",
      "away from her—which would not be so very distressing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to go away\r\n",
      "from you if you married—I mean—”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with\r\n",
      "persevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence in one way—you never\r\n",
      "would marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse of Mr. Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But Celia was\r\n",
      "administering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking up\r\n",
      "notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in her neutral\r\n",
      "tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And there\r\n",
      "never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon wanted to make\r\n",
      "people believe that you would wish to marry Mr. Ladislaw—which is ridiculous.\r\n",
      "Only James says it was to hinder Mr. Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for\r\n",
      "your money—just as if he ever would think of making you an offer. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Cadwallader said you might as well marry an Italian with white mice! But I must\r\n",
      "just go and look at baby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone,\r\n",
      "throwing a light shawl over her, and tripping away.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back\r\n",
      "helplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that moment\r\n",
      "to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on a new form,\r\n",
      "that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory would not adjust itself\r\n",
      "to the stirring of new organs. Everything was changing its aspect: her\r\n",
      "husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling towards him, every struggle between\r\n",
      "them—and yet more, her whole relation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a\r\n",
      "state of convulsive change; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself\r\n",
      "was, that she must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\r\n",
      "been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed husband, who\r\n",
      "had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she said and did. Then\r\n",
      "again she was conscious of another change which also made her tremulous; it was\r\n",
      "a sudden strange yearning of heart towards Will Ladislaw. It had never before\r\n",
      "entered her mind that he could, under any circumstances, be her lover: conceive\r\n",
      "the effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of him in that\r\n",
      "light—that perhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and\r\n",
      "this with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and questions\r\n",
      "not soon to be solved.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia saying,\r\n",
      "“That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can go to lunch, and\r\n",
      "let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think, Dodo,” Celia went on,\r\n",
      "observing nothing more than that Dorothea was leaning back in her chair, and\r\n",
      "likely to be passive, “is that Mr. Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like him,\r\n",
      "and James never did. I think the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful.\r\n",
      "And now he has behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to\r\n",
      "make yourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\r\n",
      "mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we, baby?”\r\n",
      "said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise of the world,\r\n",
      "who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to the nails, and hair\r\n",
      "enough, really, when you took his cap off, to make—you didn’t know what:—in\r\n",
      "short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he said was,\r\n",
      "“I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have you been agitated?\r\n",
      "allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of a marble coldness.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She ought not,\r\n",
      "ought she?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at Dorothea. “I\r\n",
      "hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what would give her the most\r\n",
      "repose of mind. That repose will not always come from being forbidden to act.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise. There\r\n",
      "are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit here idle?”\r\n",
      "Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with her agitation, she\r\n",
      "added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch, I think, Mr. Lydgate. I\r\n",
      "shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have serious things to do now. I have\r\n",
      "a living to give away. You know Mr. Tyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort\r\n",
      "was too much for her; she broke off and burst into sobs. \n",
      " Lydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he asked to see\r\n",
      "before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I think, more than any\r\n",
      "other prescription.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him to form\r\n",
      "some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He felt sure that she\r\n",
      "had been suffering from the strain and conflict of self-repression; and that\r\n",
      "she was likely now to feel herself only in another sort of pinfold than that\r\n",
      "from which she had been released.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he found that\r\n",
      "Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about the will. There was\r\n",
      "no help for it now—no reason for any further delay in the execution of\r\n",
      "necessary business. And the next day Sir James complied at once with her\r\n",
      "request that he would drive her to Lowick.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could hardly bear\r\n",
      "it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be able to think better\r\n",
      "about what should be done at Lowick by looking at it from a distance. And I\r\n",
      "should like to be at the Grange a little while with my uncle, and go about in\r\n",
      "all the old walks and among the people in the village.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are better\r\n",
      "out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that moment thought of\r\n",
      "the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s. But no word passed between\r\n",
      "him and Dorothea about the objectionable part of the will; indeed, both of them\r\n",
      "felt that the mention of it between them would be impossible. Sir James was\r\n",
      "shy, even with men, about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that\r\n",
      "Dorothea would have chosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was\r\n",
      "forbidden to her at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her\r\n",
      "husband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what had passed\r\n",
      "between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral claim on the property:\r\n",
      "it would then, she thought, be apparent to him as it was to her, that her\r\n",
      "husband’s strange indelicate proviso had been chiefly urged by his bitter\r\n",
      "resistance to that idea of claim, and not merely by personal feelings more\r\n",
      "difficult to talk about. Also, it must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this\r\n",
      "could be known for Will’s sake, since her friends seemed to think of him as\r\n",
      "simply an object of Mr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an\r\n",
      "Italian carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like\r\n",
      "a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s places\r\n",
      "of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed especially to her,\r\n",
      "except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was probably only the beginning of\r\n",
      "many intended directions for her guidance. In carrying out this bequest of\r\n",
      "labor to Dorothea, as in all else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating,\r\n",
      "oppressed in the plan of transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it,\r\n",
      "by the sense of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s competence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by\r\n",
      "distrust of any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for\r\n",
      "himself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do: and he\r\n",
      "willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to erect a tomb\r\n",
      "with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the future volumes a tomb;\r\n",
      "he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But the months gained on him and\r\n",
      "left his plans belated: he had only had time to ask for that promise by which\r\n",
      "he sought to keep his cold grasp on Dorothea’s life.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of her\r\n",
      "pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her judgment\r\n",
      "whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of faithfulness which\r\n",
      "is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of being controlled by duteous\r\n",
      "devotion, was made active by the imbittering discovery that in her past union\r\n",
      "there had lurked the hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living,\r\n",
      "suffering man was no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only\r\n",
      "the retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been lower\r\n",
      "than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had even blinded his\r\n",
      "scrupulous care for his own character, and made him defeat his own pride by\r\n",
      "shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the property which was the sign of that\r\n",
      "broken tie, she would have been glad to be free from it and have nothing more\r\n",
      "than her original fortune which had been settled on her, if there had not been\r\n",
      "duties attached to ownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this\r\n",
      "property many troublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\r\n",
      "thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it not\r\n",
      "impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had taken a\r\n",
      "cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation against him in\r\n",
      "her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of his purpose revolted\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she locked up\r\n",
      "again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for her—empty of any\r\n",
      "sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart had gone out to her in\r\n",
      "excuse or explanation; and she went back to Freshitt with the sense that around\r\n",
      "his last hard demand and his last injurious assertion of his power, the silence\r\n",
      "was unbroken.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and one of\r\n",
      "these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her of. Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as soon as he could, he\r\n",
      "reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of making amends for the\r\n",
      "casting-vote he had once given with an ill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of\r\n",
      "telling you anything about Mr. Tyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of\r\n",
      "another man—Mr. Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor\r\n",
      "one, and gives him a stinted provision for himself and his family. His mother,\r\n",
      "aunt, and sister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\r\n",
      "married because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such plain,\r\n",
      "easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross after old\r\n",
      "Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects: original, simple, clear.\r\n",
      "I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to have done more than he has done.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who had\r\n",
      "slipped below their own intention.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s uncommonly\r\n",
      "difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many strings pulling at\r\n",
      "once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into the wrong profession; he\r\n",
      "wants a wider range than that of a poor clergyman, and I suppose he has no\r\n",
      "interest to help him on. He is very fond of Natural History and various\r\n",
      "scientific matters, and he is hampered in reconciling these tastes with his\r\n",
      "position. He has no money to spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him\r\n",
      "into card-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\r\n",
      "money, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a little\r\n",
      "beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet, with all that,\r\n",
      "looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most blameless men I ever\r\n",
      "knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him, and those often go with a\r\n",
      "more correct outside.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,” said\r\n",
      "Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into plenty: he\r\n",
      "would be glad of the time for other things.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said Dorothea,\r\n",
      "meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the times of\r\n",
      "primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a strong desire to\r\n",
      "rescue him from his chance-gotten money.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate. “His\r\n",
      "position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a parson among\r\n",
      "parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better. Practically I find that\r\n",
      "what is called being apostolic now, is an impatience of everything in which the\r\n",
      "parson doesn’t cut the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at\r\n",
      "the Hospital: a good deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make\r\n",
      "people uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\r\n",
      "ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the birds.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our farmers\r\n",
      "and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into a volume of\r\n",
      "sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at Lowick—I mean, about\r\n",
      "imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the Apocalypse. I have always been\r\n",
      "thinking of the different ways in which Christianity is taught, and whenever I\r\n",
      "find one way that makes it a wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as\r\n",
      "the truest—I mean that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in\r\n",

      "mind, if it had the burthen of remembering any train of thought, would let it\r\n",

      "the speakers who introduced the candidate, one of them—a political personage\r\n",
      "from Brassing, who came to tell Middlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it\r\n",

      "drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval from the first was\r\n",
      "a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his energies instead of\r\n",
      "collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English gentlemen make themselves\r\n",
      "miserable by speechifying on entirely private grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke\r\n",
      "wished to serve his country by standing for Parliament—which, indeed, may also\r\n",

      "his breast-pocket, his left hand on the rail of the balcony, and his right\r\n",
      "trifling with his eye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his\r\n",

      "gentility’s sake, and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such\r\n",
      "imbecile gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\r\n",

      "unobstructed by perspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old\r\n",

      "But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We judge\r\n",
      "from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always open enough\r\n",
      "even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious Joshua Rigg had not\r\n",
      "allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was anything less than the\r\n",
      "chief good in his estimation, and he had certainly wished to call it his own.\r\n",
      "But as Warren Hastings looked at gold and thought of buying Daylesford, so\r\n",
      "Joshua Rigg looked at Stone Court and thought of buying gold. He had a very\r\n",
      "distinct and intense vision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had\r\n",
      "inherited having taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief\r\n",
      "good was to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy in\r\n",
      "a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as other boys\r\n",
      "look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the fascination had wrought\r\n",
      "itself gradually into a deep special passion; he meant, when he had property,\r\n",
      "to do many things, one of them being to marry a genteel young person; but these\r\n",
      "were all accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with. The one joy\r\n",
      "after which his soul thirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a\r\n",
      "much-frequented quay, to have locks all round him of which he held the keys,\r\n",
      "and to look sublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations,\r\n",
      "while helpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an iron\r\n",
      "lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling him to master\r\n",
      "all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when others were thinking that\r\n",
      "he had settled at Stone Court for life, Joshua himself was thinking that the\r\n",
      "moment now was not far off when he should settle on the North Quay with the\r\n",
      "best appointments in safes and locks.\r\n",

      "conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for some time\r\n",
      "entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it thus, but not too\r\n",
      "confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded phraseology. His doubts\r\n",
      "did not arise from the possible relations of the event to Joshua Rigg’s\r\n",
      "destiny, which belonged to the unmapped regions not taken under the\r\n",
      "providential government, except perhaps in an imperfect colonial way; but they\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of deceiving him:\r\n",
      "it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his mode of explaining\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode, hardly\r\n",
      "fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become the proprietor\r\n",
      "of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were worthy to know,” had\r\n",
      "become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of conversation to his\r\n",

      "passed without his riding thither and looking over some part of the farm with\r\n",
      "the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in that quiet spot, when the new\r\n",
      "hay-ricks lately set up were sending forth odors to mingle with the breath of\r\n",
      "the rich old garden. One evening, while the sun was still above the horizon and\r\n",
      "burning in golden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was\r\n",
      "pausing on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\r\n",
      "met him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable drainage, and\r\n",
      "was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more than\r\n",
      "usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He was\r\n",
      "doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in himself; but\r\n",
      "that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when the sense of demerit\r\n",
      "does not take a distinct shape in memory and revive the tingling of shame or\r\n",
      "the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be held with intense satisfaction when the\r\n",
      "depth of our sinning is but a measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a\r\n",
      "clenching proof that we are peculiar instruments of the divine intention. The\r\n",
      "memory has as many moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama.\r\n",
      "At this moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\r\n",
      "far-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out preaching\r\n",
      "beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service of exhortation in\r\n",
      "prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was his own facility in\r\n",
      "expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted by the return of Caleb\r\n",
      "Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just shaking his bridle before\r\n",
      "starting, when he exclaimed—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane? He’s like\r\n",
      "one of those men one sees about after the races.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no reply.\r\n",
      "The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose appearance presented\r\n",
      "no other change than such as was due to a suit of black and a crape hat-band.\r\n",
      "He was within three yards of the horseman now, and they could see the flash of\r\n",
      "recognition in his face as he whirled his stick upward, looking all the while\r\n",
      "at Mr. Bulstrode, and at last exclaiming:—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the five-and-twenty\r\n",
      "years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you, eh? you didn’t expect to\r\n",
      "see me here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To say that Mr. Raffles’\r\n",
      "manner was rather excited would be only one mode of saying that it was evening.\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth could see that there was a moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, but it ended in his putting out his hand coldly to Raffles and\r\n",
      "saying—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting himself in a\r\n",
      "swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m not so surprised at\r\n",
      "seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a letter—what you may call a\r\n",
      "providential thing. It’s uncommonly fortunate I met you, though; for I don’t\r\n",
      "care about seeing my stepson: he’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone\r\n",
      "now. To tell the truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your\r\n",
      "address, for—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger on the\r\n",
      "spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose acquaintance with\r\n",
      "Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s life so unlike anything that\r\n",
      "was known of him in Middlemarch that they must have the nature of a secret to\r\n",
      "pique curiosity. But Caleb was peculiar: certain human tendencies which are\r\n",
      "commonly strong were almost absent from his mind; and one of these was\r\n",
      "curiosity about personal affairs. Especially if there was anything\r\n",
      "discreditable to be found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to\r\n",
      "know it; and if he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\r\n",
      "discovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred his horse,\r\n",
      "and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must be getting home,”\r\n",
      "set off at a trot.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued. “That was\r\n",
      "not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The Shrubs,’—they may\r\n",
      "be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the London concern\r\n",
      "altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural mansion to invite me to.\r\n",
      "Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady must have been dead a pretty long\r\n",
      "while—gone to glory without the pain of knowing how poor her daughter was, eh?\r\n",
      "But, by Jove! you’re very pale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home,\r\n",
      "I’ll walk by your side.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue. Five\r\n",
      "minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its evening\r\n",
      "sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin seemed to be a\r\n",
      "question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation an exercise of the\r\n",
      "closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private vision adjusted solely by\r\n",
      "spiritual relations and conceptions of the divine purposes. And now, as if by\r\n",
      "some hideous magic, this loud red figure had risen before him in unmanageable\r\n",
      "solidity—an incorporate past which had not entered into his imagination of\r\n",
      "chastisements. But Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to\r\n",
      "act or speak rashly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you can, if\r\n",
      "you please, rest here.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about seeing my\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before he said,\r\n",
      "“Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from the coach-road. I\r\n",
      "never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I like is a smart vehicle and\r\n",
      "a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy in the saddle. What a pleasant\r\n",
      "surprise it must be to you to see me, old fellow!” he continued, as they turned\r\n",
      "towards the house. “You don’t say so; but you never took your luck heartily—you\r\n",
      "were always thinking of improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving\r\n",
      "your luck.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\r\n",
      "acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are now\r\n",
      "assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the more readily\r\n",
      "rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did not lie in our\r\n",
      "former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more than twenty years of\r\n",
      "separation.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my heart,\r\n",
      "and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings have ripened for\r\n",
      "you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in the house now. Josh filled\r\n",
      "my flask well the last time.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac was not\r\n",
      "stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint of annoyance\r\n",
      "always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least clear that further\r\n",
      "objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving orders to the housekeeper\r\n",
      "for the accommodation of the guest, had a resolute air of quietude.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the service\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the wainscoted\r\n",
      "parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly enjoy\r\n",
      "each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will therefore be to part\r\n",
      "as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished to meet me, you probably\r\n",
      "considered that you had some business to transact with me. But under the\r\n",
      "circumstances I will invite you to remain here for the night, and I will myself\r\n",
      "ride over here early to-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can\r\n",
      "receive any communication you have to make to me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a little dull\r\n",
      "for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night, with this good liquor\r\n",
      "and the prospect of seeing you again in the morning. You’re a much better host\r\n",
      "than my stepson was; but Josh owed me a bit of a grudge for marrying his\r\n",
      "mother; and between you and me there was never anything but kindness.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and sneering in\r\n",
      "Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had determined to wait\r\n",
      "till he was quite sober before he spent more words upon him. But he rode home\r\n",
      "with a terribly lucid vision of the difficulty there would be in arranging any\r\n",
      "result that could be permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable\r\n",
      "that he should wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could\r\n",
      "not be regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might have\r\n",
      "sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument of good; but\r\n",
      "the threat must have been permitted, and was a chastisement of a new kind. It\r\n",
      "was an hour of anguish for him very different from the hours in which his\r\n",
      "struggle had been securely private, and which had ended with a sense that his\r\n",
      "secret misdeeds were pardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even\r\n",
      "when committed—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\r\n",
      "desire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the divine\r\n",
      "scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling and a rock of\r\n",
      "offence? For who would understand the work within him? Who would not, when\r\n",
      "there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him, confound his whole life and\r\n",
      "the truths he had espoused, in one heap of obloquy?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind clad his\r\n",
      "most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman ends. But even\r\n",
      "while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s orbit and the solar\r\n",
      "system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is the stable earth and the\r\n",
      "changing day. And now within all the automatic succession of theoretic\r\n",
      "phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and the ache of oncoming fever when\r\n",
      "we are discussing abstract pain, was the forecast of disgrace in the presence\r\n",
      "of his neighbors and of his own wife. For the pain, as well as the public\r\n",
      "estimate of disgrace, depends on the amount of previous profession. To men who\r\n",
      "only aim at escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace.\r\n",
      "But Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again reached Stone\r\n",
      "Court. The fine old place never looked more like a delightful home than at that\r\n",
      "moment; the great white lilies were in flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty\r\n",
      "leaves all silvered with dew, were running away over the low stone wall; the\r\n",
      "very noises all around had a heart of peace within them. But everything was\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted parlor over\r\n",
      "their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to take at that early\r\n",
      "hour. The difference between his morning and evening self was not so great as\r\n",
      "his companion had imagined that it might be; the delight in tormenting was\r\n",
      "perhaps even the stronger because his spirits were rather less highly pitched.\r\n",
      "Certainly his manners seemed more disagreeable by the morning light.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who could\r\n",
      "hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without eating it, “I shall\r\n",
      "be obliged if you will mention at once the ground on which you wished to meet\r\n",
      "with me. I presume that you have a home elsewhere and will be glad to return to\r\n",

      "marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome family likeness to old Nick,\r\n",
      "but that was your mother’s fault, calling you Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see\r\n",
      "me again? I expected an invite to stay with you at some pretty place. My own\r\n",

      "myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at the turnpike when I\r\n",
      "got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more than fronts and wristbands;\r\n",
      "and with this suit of mourning, straps and everything, I should do you credit\r\n",
      "among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles had pushed away his chair and looked down at\r\n",
      "himself, particularly at his straps. His chief intention was to annoy\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, but he really thought that his appearance now would produce a good\r\n",
      "effect, and that he was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning\r\n",
      "style which implied solid connections.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode, after a\r\n",
      "moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I always do\r\n",
      "it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but little. I’ve often\r\n",
      "thought since, I might have done better by telling the old woman that I’d found\r\n",
      "her daughter and her grandchild: it would have suited my feelings better; I’ve\r\n",
      "got a soft place in my heart. But you’ve buried the old lady by this time, I\r\n",
      "suppose—it’s all one to her now. And you’ve got your fortune out of that\r\n",
      "profitable business which had such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a\r\n",
      "nob, buying land, being a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh?\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue was worse\r\n",
      "than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was not a nightmare,\r\n",
      "but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering nausea, and did not speak,\r\n",
      "but was considering diligently whether he should not leave Raffles to do as he\r\n",
      "would, and simply defy him as a slanderer. The man would soon show himself\r\n",
      "disreputable enough to make people disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any\r\n",
      "ugly-looking truth about you,” said discerning consciousness. And again:\r\n",
      "it seemed no wrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from\r\n",
      "the direct falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look back\r\n",
      "on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax customs, and\r\n",
      "another to enter deliberately on the necessity of falsehood.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time to the\r\n",

      "“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly with me\r\n",

      "has no chance with them. I married when I came back—a nice woman in the tobacco\r\n",
      "trade—very fond of me—but the trade was restricted, as we say. She had been\r\n",
      "settled there a good many years by a friend; but there was a son too much in\r\n",
      "the case. Josh and I never hit it off. However, I made the most of the\r\n",
      "position, and I’ve always taken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the\r\n",
      "square with me; I’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I\r\n",
      "didn’t look you up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little\r\n",
      "dilatory. I thought you were trading and praying away in London still, and\r\n",

      "blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode, there was an evident\r\n",
      "selection of statements, as if they had been so many moves at chess. Meanwhile\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a man to\r\n",

      "any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you with a regular annuity—in\r\n",
      "quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a promise to remain at a distance from\r\n",
      "this neighborhood. It is in your power to choose. If you insist on remaining\r\n",

      "Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a couple of hundreds—come,\r\n",
      "that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor bright!—pick up my portmanteau and go\r\n",
      "away. But I shall not give up my liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and\r\n",
      "go where I like. Perhaps it may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles suggested, when the latter said,\r\n",
      "lifting up his finger as if with a sudden recollection—\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you; I’d a\r\n",
      "tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find her, but I found\r\n",
      "out her husband’s name, and I made a note of it. But hang it, I lost my\r\n",
      "pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it again. I’ve got my\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and then\r\n",
      "turned towards the window to watch the banker riding away—virtually at his\r\n",

      "triumphant laugh.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a sense that\r\n",
      "he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was too slight, and he\r\n",
      "soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men were more impatient of private\r\n",
      "occupation or more in need of making themselves continually heard than Mr.\r\n",
      "Raffles. He preferred using his time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed relieving with\r\n",

      "That action of memory which he had tried to set going, and had abandoned in\r\n",
      "despair, had suddenly completed itself without conscious effort—a common\r\n",
      "experience, agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of\r\n",
      "no value. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\r\n",
      "name, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not being\r\n",
      "at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to tell Bulstrode:\r\n",
      "there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like that of Mr. Raffles\r\n",

      "her once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her with choice and\r\n",
      "beseeching, what would she think of in her journeying, what would she look for\r\n",
      "when the herds passed her? Surely for the gaze which had found her, and which\r\n",
      "she would know again. Life would be no better than candle-light tinsel and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "meet again, and perhaps she was wrong to wish for a meeting that others might\r\n",
      "find many good reasons against. Still “I do wish it” came at the end of those\r\n",

      "in making an exact statement for herself of her income and affairs. She had not\r\n",
      "yet applied herself to her work, but was seated with her hands folded on her\r\n",
      "lap, looking out along the avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf\r\n",
      "was at rest in the sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to\r\n",
      "represent the prospect of her life, full of motiveless ease—motiveless, if her\r\n",
      "own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow’s cap of\r\n",
      "those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown standing up; the\r\n",
      "dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of crape; but this heavy\r\n",
      "solemnity of clothing made her face look all the younger, with its recovered\r\n",
      "bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of her eyes.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw was\r\n",
      "below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will see him,” said Dorothea, rising immediately. “Let him be shown into the\r\n",
      "drawing-room.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her—the one least\r\n",
      "associated with the trials of her married life: the damask matched the\r\n",
      "wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two tall mirrors and tables\r\n",
      "with nothing on them—in brief, it was a room where you had no reason for\r\n",
      "sitting in one place rather than in another. It was below the boudoir, and had\r\n",
      "also a bow-window looking out on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw into it the window was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out\r\n",
      "now and then without minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and\r\n",
      "uninhabited.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Glad to see you here again, sir,” said Pratt, lingering to adjust a blind.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,” said Will, who wished even the butler\r\n",

      "widow.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very sorry to hear it, sir,” said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a servant who\r\n",
      "was to be told nothing, he knew the fact of which Ladislaw was still ignorant,\r\n",
      "and had drawn his inferences; indeed, had not differed from his betrothed\r\n",
      "Tantripp when she said, “Your master was as jealous as a fiend—and no reason.\r\n",
      "Madam would look higher than Mr. Ladislaw, else I don’t know her. Mrs.\r\n",

      "mourning’s over.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his hat in his hand\r\n",
      "before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that first meeting\r\n",
      "in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm. This time he felt\r\n",
      "miserable but determined, while she was in a state of agitation which could not\r\n",
      "be hidden. Just outside the door she had felt that this longed-for meeting was\r\n",
      "after all too difficult, and when she saw Will advancing towards her, the deep\r\n",
      "blush which was rare in her came with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew\r\n",
      "how it was, but neither of them spoke. She gave her hand for a moment, and then\r\n",
      "they went to sit down near the window, she on one settee and he on another\r\n",
      "opposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him not like Dorothea that\r\n",
      "the mere fact of her being a widow should cause such a change in her manner of\r\n",
      "receiving him; and he knew of no other condition which could have affected\r\n",
      "their previous relation to each other—except that, as his imagination at once\r\n",
      "told him, her friends might have been poisoning her mind with their suspicions\r\n",
      "of him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,” said Will; “I could not bear\r\n",
      "to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing you to say\r\n",
      "good-by.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not wished to\r\n",
      "see me,” said Dorothea, her habit of speaking with perfect genuineness\r\n",
      "asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation. “Are you going away\r\n",
      "immediately?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a barrister,\r\n",
      "since, they say, that is the preparation for all public business. There will be\r\n",
      "a great deal of political work to be done by-and-by, and I mean to try and do\r\n",
      "some of it. Other men have managed to win an honorable position for themselves\r\n",
      "without family or money.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that will make it all the more honorable,” said Dorothea, ardently.\r\n",
      "“Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my uncle how well you\r\n",
      "speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you leave off, and how clearly\r\n",
      "you can explain things. And you care that justice should be done to every one.\r\n",
      "I am so glad. When we were in Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and\r\n",
      "art, and the things that adorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you\r\n",
      "think about the rest of the world.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While she was speaking Dorothea had lost her personal embarrassment, and had\r\n",
      "become like her former self. She looked at Will with a direct glance, full of\r\n",
      "delighted confidence.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here again till\r\n",
      "I have made myself of some mark in the world?” said Will, trying hard to\r\n",
      "reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get an expression of\r\n",
      "strong feeling from Dorothea.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was not aware how long it was before she answered. She had turned her head\r\n",
      "and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which seemed to have in\r\n",
      "them the summers of all the years when Will would be away. This was not\r\n",
      "judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of studying her manners: she\r\n",
      "thought only of bowing to a sad necessity which divided her from Will. Those\r\n",
      "first words of his about his intentions had seemed to make everything clear to\r\n",
      "her: he knew, she supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon’s final conduct in relation\r\n",
      "to him, and it had come to him with the same sort of shock as to herself. He\r\n",
      "had never felt more than friendship for her—had never had anything in his mind\r\n",
      "to justify what she felt to be her husband’s outrage on the feelings of both:\r\n",
      "and that friendship he still felt. Something which may be called an inward\r\n",
      "silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she said with a pure voice, just\r\n",
      "trembling in the last words as if only from its liquid flexibility—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy when I\r\n",
      "hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have patience. It will\r\n",
      "perhaps be a long while.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will never quite knew how it was that he saved himself from falling down at her\r\n",
      "feet, when the “long while” came forth with its gentle tremor. He used to say\r\n",
      "that the horrible hue and surface of her crape dress was most likely the\r\n",
      "sufficient controlling force. He sat still, however, and only said—\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems not likely to be\r\n",
      "so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at Lowick, haven’t I?” She\r\n",
      "smiled.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” Will burst out passionately, rising, with his hat still in his\r\n",
      "hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he suddenly turned and leaned\r\n",
      "his back against it. The blood had mounted to his face and neck, and he looked\r\n",
      "almost angry. It had seemed to him as if they were like two creatures slowly\r\n",
      "turning to marble in each other’s presence, while their hearts were conscious\r\n",
      "and their eyes were yearning. But there was no help for it. It should never be\r\n",
      "true of him that in this meeting to which he had come with bitter resolution he\r\n",
      "had ended by a confession which might be interpreted into asking for her\r\n",
      "fortune. Moreover, it was actually true that he was fearful of the effect which\r\n",
      "such confessions might have on Dorothea herself.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked at him from that distance in some trouble, imagining that there\r\n",
      "might have been an offence in her words. But all the while there was a current\r\n",
      "of thought in her about his probable want of money, and the impossibility of\r\n",
      "her helping him. If her uncle had been at home, something might have been done\r\n",
      "through him! It was this preoccupation with the hardship of Will’s wanting\r\n",
      "money, while she had what ought to have been his share, which led her to say,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You are very good,” said Will, irritably. “No; I don’t mind about it. It is\r\n",

      "exasperating to have his grandmother’s portrait offered him at that moment. But\r\n",
      "to Dorothea’s feeling his words had a peculiar sting. She rose and said with a\r\n",

      "Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a\r\n",
      "dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way towards\r\n",
      "her. Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity. Something was\r\n",
      "keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to conjecture what was in the\r\n",
      "other. Will had really never thought of himself as having a claim of\r\n",
      "inheritance on the property which was held by Dorothea, and would have required\r\n",
      "a narrative to make him understand her present feeling.\r\n",

      "“I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,” he said. “But poverty\r\n",

      "silent when we long to speak. I used to despise women a little for not shaping\r\n",
      "their lives more, and doing better things. I was very fond of doing as I liked,\r\n",
      "but I have almost given it up,” she ended, smiling playfully.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,” said Will.\r\n",
      "He was standing two yards from her with his mind full of contradictory desires\r\n",
      "and resolves—desiring some unmistakable proof that she loved him, and yet\r\n",
      "dreading the position into which such a proof might bring him. “The thing one\r\n",

      "“How is Celia?” that he was obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him.\r\n",

      "time.\r\n",

      "Dorothea shook her head slowly. “Not anybody at all. I have delightful plans. I\r\n",

      "colony, where everybody should work, and all the work should be done well. I\r\n",

      "me! it reminds me of bits in the ‘Messiah’—‘and straightway there appeared a\r\n",

      "numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his expectation of getting\r\n",
      "work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he said, “Business breeds.” And one\r\n",
      "form of business which was beginning to breed just then was the construction of\r\n",

      "that the infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of\r\n",
      "Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to two\r\n",
      "persons who were dear to him. The submarine railway may have its difficulties;\r\n",

      "claims for damages not only measurable but sentimental. In the hundred to which\r\n",
      "Middlemarch belonged railways were as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or\r\n",
      "the imminent horrors of Cholera, and those who held the most decided views on\r\n",
      "the subject were women and landholders. Women both old and young regarded\r\n",
      "travelling by steam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by\r\n",
      "saying that nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while\r\n",
      "proprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as Mr.\r\n",

      "“Well, there’s this to be said, Jane,” Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering his\r\n",

      "system. But he set about acting on his views in a thoroughly diplomatic manner,\r\n",
      "by stimulating suspicion. His side of Lowick was the most remote from the\r\n",
      "village, and the houses of the laboring people were either lone cottages or\r\n",
      "were collected in a hamlet called Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits\r\n",
      "made a little centre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public opinion in\r\n",
      "Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy corner had not the\r\n",
      "proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding rather that it was likely to\r\n",
      "be against the poor man, and that suspicion was the only wise attitude with\r\n",
      "regard to it. Even the rumor of Reform had not yet excited any millennial\r\n",
      "expectations in Frick, there being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous\r\n",
      "grains to fatten Hiram Ford’s pig, or of a publican at the “Weights and Scales”\r\n",
      "who would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the three\r\n",
      "neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without distinct good of\r\n",
      "this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing with the bragging of\r\n",
      "pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every knowing person. The men of\r\n",
      "Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given to fanaticism than to a strong\r\n",
      "muscular suspicion; less inclined to believe that they were peculiarly cared\r\n",
      "for by heaven, than to regard heaven itself as rather disposed to take them\r\n",
      "in—a disposition observable in the weather.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon Featherstone to\r\n",
      "work upon, he having more plenteous ideas of the same order, with a suspicion\r\n",
      "of heaven and earth which was better fed and more entirely at leisure. Solomon\r\n",
      "was overseer of the roads at that time, and on his slow-paced cob often took\r\n",
      "his rounds by Frick to look at the workmen getting the stones there, pausing\r\n",
      "with a mysterious deliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that\r\n",
      "he had some other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.\r\n",
      "After looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he would raise\r\n",
      "his eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he would shake his bridle,\r\n",
      "touch his horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly onward. The hour-hand\r\n",
      "of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr. Solomon, who had an agreeable sense\r\n",
      "that he could afford to be slow. He was in the habit of pausing for a cautious,\r\n",
      "vaguely designing chat with every hedger or ditcher on his way, and was\r\n",
      "especially willing to listen even to news which he had heard before, feeling\r\n",

      "day, however, he got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he\r\n",
      "himself contributed information. He wished to know whether Hiram had seen\r\n",
      "fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called themselves\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit,” said Mr. Solomon. “And cutting up fine land such as this parish!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I’ve heard say,\r\n",

      "that her father had some business which took him to Yoddrell’s farm in the\r\n",

      "belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb expected to dispose of advantageously\r\n",
      "for Dorothea (it must be confessed that his bias was towards getting the best\r\n",

      "in walking with his assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his work, he\r\n",
      "encountered the party of the company’s agents, who were adjusting their\r\n",
      "spirit-level. After a little chat he left them, observing that by-and-by they\r\n",

      "\n",

      "The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along the lanes\r\n",

      "him if he did enter it, and with the working-day world showing no eager need\r\n",
      "whatever of a young gentleman without capital and generally unskilled. It was\r\n",
      "the harder to Fred’s disposition because his father, satisfied that he was no\r\n",
      "longer rebellious, was in good humor with him, and had sent him on this\r\n",
      "pleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he had fixed on what he\r\n",

      "admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the more difficult\r\n",

      "could not get him an “appointment”) which was at once gentlemanly, lucrative,\r\n",
      "and to be followed without special knowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick\r\n",
      "in this mood, and slackening his pace while he reflected whether he should\r\n",
      "venture to go round by Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he could see over the\r\n",
      "hedges from one field to another. Suddenly a noise roused his attention, and on\r\n",
      "the far side of a field on his left hand he could see six or seven men in\r\n",
      "smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive approach towards\r\n",
      "the four railway agents who were facing them, while Caleb Garth and his\r\n",
      "assistant were hastening across the field to join the threatened group. Fred,\r\n",
      "delayed a few moments by having to find the gate, could not gallop up to the\r\n",

      "as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting in front of the\r\n",

      "confusion. “What do you confounded fools mean?” shouted Fred, pursuing the\r\n",
      "divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right and left with his whip. “I’ll\r\n",

      "look of vexation, as if he had forgotten Fred’s presence, but suddenly he\r\n",

      "moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a striking mixture in\r\n",
      "him—which came from his having always been a hard-working man himself—of\r\n",
      "rigorous notions about workmen and practical indulgence towards them. To do a\r\n",
      "good day’s work and to do it well, he held to be part of their welfare, as it\r\n",
      "was the chief part of his own happiness; but he had a strong sense of\r\n",
      "fellowship with them. When he advanced towards the laborers they had not gone\r\n",

      "in each turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or three\r\n",
      "yards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly with one hand in\r\n",
      "his pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, and had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why, my lads, how’s this?” he began, taking as usual to brief phrases, which\r\n",

      "possession of an undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of\r\n",
      "feeling, and can let it fall like a giant’s club on your neatly carved argument\r\n",
      "for a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at command, even\r\n",

      "learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to lay a foundation yet.”\r\n",

      "is, you must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honorable\r\n",
      "to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and\r\n",
      "in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s\r\n",

      "shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope of Mary.\r\n",
      "Really, if I could get some other profession, business—anything that I am at\r\n",
      "all fit for, I would work hard, I would deserve your good opinion. I should\r\n",
      "like to have to do with outdoor things. I know a good deal about land and\r\n",
      "cattle already. I used to believe, you know—though you will think me rather\r\n",
      "foolish for it—that I should have land of my own. I am sure knowledge of that\r\n",
      "sort would come easily to me, especially if I could be under you in any way.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, yet; but I must tell him. I am only waiting to know what I can do\r\n",
      "instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint him, but a man\r\n",
      "ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he is four-and-twenty. How could\r\n",
      "I know when I was fifteen, what it would be right for me to do now? My\r\n",
      "education was a mistake.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But hearken to this, Fred,” said Caleb. “Are you sure Mary is fond of you, or\r\n",
      "would ever have you?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had forbidden me—I didn’t\r\n",
      "know what else to do,” said Fred, apologetically. “And he says that I have\r\n",
      "every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an honorable position—I mean, out\r\n",
      "of the Church. I dare say you think it unwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be\r\n",
      "troubling you and obtruding my own wishes about Mary, before I have done\r\n",
      "anything at all for myself. Of course I have not the least claim—indeed, I have\r\n",
      "already a debt to you which will never be discharged, even when I have been\r\n",
      "able to pay it in the shape of money.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "“Yes, my boy, you have a claim,” said Caleb, with much feeling in his voice.\r\n",
      "“The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them forward. I was\r\n",
      "young myself once and had to do without much help; but help would have been\r\n",
      "welcome to me, if it had been only for the fellow-feeling’s sake. But I must\r\n",
      "consider. Come to me to-morrow at the office, at nine o’clock. At the office,\r\n",
      "mind.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it must be\r\n",
      "confessed that before he reached home he had taken his resolution. With regard\r\n",
      "to a large number of matters about which other men are decided or obstinate, he\r\n",
      "was the most easily manageable man in the world. He never knew what meat he\r\n",
      "would choose, and if Susan had said that they ought to live in a four-roomed\r\n",
      "cottage, in order to save, he would have said, “Let us go,” without inquiring\r\n",
      "into details. But where Caleb’s feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he\r\n",
      "was a ruler; and in spite of his mildness and timidity in reproving, every one\r\n",
      "about him knew that on the exceptional occasions when he chose, he was\r\n",
      "absolute. He never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some one else’s\r\n",
      "behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on the hundredth she was\r\n",
      "often aware that she would have to perform the singularly difficult task of\r\n",
      "carrying out her own principle, and to make herself subordinate.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is come round as I thought, Susan,” said Caleb, when they were seated alone\r\n",
      "in the evening. He had already narrated the adventure which had brought about\r\n",
      "Fred’s sharing in his work, but had kept back the further result. “The children\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“After we’d done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He can’t bear to be a\r\n",
      "clergyman, and Mary says she won’t have him if he is one; and the lad would\r\n",
      "like to be under me and give his mind to business. And I’ve determined to take\r\n",
      "him and make a man of him.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a fine thing to do,” said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly against the\r\n",
      "back of his chair, and grasping the elbows. “I shall have trouble with him, but\r\n",
      "I think I shall carry it through. The lad loves Mary, and a true love for a\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a word. I asked her about Fred once; I gave her a bit of a warning. But\r\n",
      "she assured me she would never marry an idle self-indulgent man—nothing since.\r\n",
      "But it seems Fred set on Mr. Farebrother to talk to her, because she had\r\n",
      "forbidden him to speak himself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she is\r\n",
      "fond of Fred, but says he must not be a clergyman. Fred’s heart is fixed on\r\n",
      "Mary, that I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad—and we always liked\r\n",
      "him, Susan.”\r\n",

      "“Why—a pity?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ah?” said Caleb, with surprise.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her, and meant to make\r\n",
      "her an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him as an envoy, there is\r\n",
      "an end to that better prospect.” There was a severe precision in Mrs. Garth’s\r\n",
      "utterance. She was vexed and disappointed, but she was bent on abstaining from\r\n",
      "useless words.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He looked at the\r\n",
      "floor and moved his head and hands in accompaniment to some inward\r\n",
      "argumentation. At last he said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have been\r\n",
      "glad for your sake. I’ve always felt that your belongings have never been on a\r\n",
      "level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain man.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,” said Mrs. Garth,\r\n",

      "mark.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would have\r\n",
      "been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred. The lad is\r\n",
      "good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he’s put in the right way; and he\r\n",
      "loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she has given him a sort of\r\n",
      "promise according to what he turns out. I say, that young man’s soul is in my\r\n",
      "hand; and I’ll do the best I can for him, so help me God! It’s my duty, Susan.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling down her\r\n",
      "face before her husband had finished. It came from the pressure of various\r\n",
      "feelings, in which there was much affection and some vexation. She wiped it\r\n",
      "away quickly, saying—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in that\r\n",
      "way, Caleb.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That signifies nothing—what other men would think. I’ve got a clear feeling\r\n",
      "inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will go with me,\r\n",
      "Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary, poor child.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caleb, leaning back in his chair, looked with anxious appeal towards his wife.\r\n",
      "She rose and kissed him, saying, “God bless you, Caleb! Our children have a\r\n",
      "good father.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of her\r\n",
      "words. She felt sure that her husband’s conduct would be misunderstood, and\r\n",
      "about Fred she was rational and unhopeful. Which would turn out to have the\r\n",
      "more foresight in it—her rationality or Caleb’s ardent generosity?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be gone\r\n",
      "through which he was not prepared for.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now Fred,” said Caleb, “you will have some desk-work. I have always done a\r\n",
      "good deal of writing myself, but I can’t do without help, and as I want you to\r\n",
      "understand the accounts and get the values into your head, I mean to do without\r\n",
      "another clerk. So you must buckle to. How are you at writing and arithmetic?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he had not thought of desk-work;\r\n",
      "but he was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink. “I’m not afraid of\r\n",
      "arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me. I think you know my\r\n",
      "writing.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us see,” said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and handing\r\n",
      "it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. “Copy me a line or two of\r\n",
      "that valuation, with the figures at the end.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to write\r\n",
      "legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred wrote the lines\r\n",
      "demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any viscount or bishop of the day:\r\n",
      "the vowels were all alike and the consonants only distinguishable as turning up\r\n",
      "or down, the strokes had a blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep\r\n",
      "the line—in short, it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret\r\n",
      "when you know beforehand what the writer means.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Caleb looked on, his visage showed a growing depression, but when Fred\r\n",
      "handed him the paper he gave something like a snarl, and rapped the paper\r\n",
      "passionately with the back of his hand. Bad work like this dispelled all\r\n",
      "Caleb’s mildness.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The deuce!” he exclaimed, snarlingly. “To think that this is a country where a\r\n",
      "man’s education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it turns you out this!”\r\n",
      "Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his spectacles and looking at the\r\n",
      "unfortunate scribe, “The Lord have mercy on us, Fred, I can’t put up with\r\n",
      "this!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can I do, Mr. Garth?” said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low, not\r\n",
      "only at the estimate of his handwriting, but at the vision of himself as liable\r\n",
      "to be ranked with office clerks.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line. What’s the use\r\n",
      "of writing at all if nobody can understand it?” asked Caleb, energetically,\r\n",
      "quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the work. “Is there so little\r\n",
      "business in the world that you must be sending puzzles over the country? But\r\n",
      "that’s the way people are brought up. I should lose no end of time with the\r\n",
      "letters some people send me, if Susan did not make them out for me. It’s\r\n",
      "disgusting.” Here Caleb tossed the paper from him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered what\r\n",
      "was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the fine-looking young\r\n",
      "fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather patchy as he bit his lip with\r\n",
      "mortification. Fred was struggling with many thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so\r\n",
      "kind and encouraging at the beginning of their interview, that gratitude and\r\n",
      "hopefulness had been at a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He\r\n",
      "had not thought of desk-work—in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he\r\n",
      "wanted an occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot tell\r\n",
      "what might have been the consequences if he had not distinctly promised himself\r\n",
      "that he would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her that he was engaged to work\r\n",
      "under her father. He did not like to disappoint himself there.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very sorry,” were all the words that he could muster. But Mr. Garth was\r\n",
      "already relenting.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must make the best of it, Fred,” he began, with a return to his usual quiet\r\n",
      "tone. “Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go at it with a will, and\r\n",
      "sit up at night if the day-time isn’t enough. We’ll be patient, my boy. Callum\r\n",
      "shall go on with the books for a bit, while you are learning. But now I must be\r\n",
      "off,” said Caleb, rising. “You must let your father know our agreement. You’ll\r\n",
      "save me Callum’s salary, you know, when you can write; and I can afford to give\r\n",
      "you eighty pounds for the first year, and more after.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his parents, the relative effect on\r\n",
      "the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his memory. He went\r\n",
      "straight from Mr. Garth’s office to the warehouse, rightly feeling that the\r\n",
      "most respectful way in which he could behave to his father was to make the\r\n",
      "painful communication as gravely and formally as possible. Moreover, the\r\n",
      "decision would be more certainly understood to be final, if the interview took\r\n",
      "place in his father’s gravest hours, which were always those spent in his\r\n",
      "private room at the warehouse.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he had done and\r\n",
      "was resolved to do, expressing at the end his regret that he should be the\r\n",
      "cause of disappointment to his father, and taking the blame on his own\r\n",
      "deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired Fred with strong, simple\r\n",
      "words.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an exclamation, a\r\n",
      "silence which in his impatient temperament was a sign of unusual emotion. He\r\n",
      "had not been in good spirits about trade that morning, and the slight\r\n",
      "bitterness in his lips grew intense as he listened. When Fred had ended, there\r\n",
      "was a pause of nearly a minute, during which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his\r\n",
      "desk and turned the key emphatically. Then he looked at his son steadily, and\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you’ve made up your mind at last, sir?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, father.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well; stick to it. I’ve no more to say. You’ve thrown away your\r\n",
      "education, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means of\r\n",
      "rising, that’s all.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as much of a\r\n",
      "gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a curate. But I am\r\n",
      "grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only hope, when\r\n",
      "you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the pains you spend\r\n",
      "on him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was very cutting to Fred. His father was using that unfair advantage\r\n",
      "possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and see our own past as\r\n",
      "if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality, Mr. Vincy’s wishes about his\r\n",
      "son had had a great deal of pride, inconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in\r\n",
      "them. But still the disappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as\r\n",
      "if he were being banished with a malediction.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?” he said, after\r\n",
      "rising to go; “I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my board, as of\r\n",
      "course I should wish to do.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Board be hanged!” said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his disgust at the\r\n",
      "notion that Fred’s keep would be missed at his table. “Of course your mother\r\n",
      "will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you, you understand; and\r\n",
      "you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a suit or two less, I fancy,\r\n",
      "when you have to pay for ’em.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the vexation I\r\n",
      "have caused you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Vincy from his chair threw a quick glance upward at his son, who had\r\n",
      "advanced near to him, and then gave his hand, saying hurriedly, “Yes, yes, let\r\n",
      "us say no more.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his mother, but she\r\n",
      "was inconsolable, having before her eyes what perhaps her husband had never\r\n",
      "thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary Garth, that her life would\r\n",
      "henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual infusion of Garths and their ways, and\r\n",
      "that her darling boy, with his beautiful face and stylish air “beyond anybody\r\n",
      "else’s son in Middlemarch,” would be sure to get like that family in plainness\r\n",
      "of appearance and carelessness about his clothes. To her it seemed that there\r\n",
      "was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred, but she dared\r\n",
      "not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it had made him “fly out”\r\n",
      "at her as he had never done before. Her temper was too sweet for her to show\r\n",
      "any anger, but she felt that her happiness had received a bruise, and for\r\n",
      "several days merely to look at Fred made her cry a little as if he were the\r\n",
      "subject of some baleful prophecy. Perhaps she was the slower to recover her\r\n",
      "usual cheerfulness because Fred had warned her that she must not reopen the\r\n",
      "sore question with his father, who had accepted his decision and forgiven him.\r\n",
      "If her husband had been vehement against Fred, she would have been urged into\r\n",
      "defence of her darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr. Vincy said to\r\n",
      "her—\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good reason,” said\r\n",
      "Fred, his spirit rising a little at the perception of something like a\r\n",
      "disposition to lecture him. “I happen to have behaved just the worst to the\r\n",
      "people I can’t help wishing for the most from. But while two men like Mr. Garth\r\n",
      "and Mr. Farebrother have not given me up, I don’t see why I should give myself\r\n",
      "up.” Fred thought it might be well to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Assuredly,” said she, with gathering emphasis. “A young man for whom two such\r\n",
      "elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he threw himself away\r\n",
      "and made their sacrifices vain.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, “I hope it will\r\n",
      "not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement to believe that\r\n",
      "I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that? You were not surprised, I\r\n",

      "evident enough.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?” returned Mrs. Garth, who\r\n",
      "thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the fact that Mary’s\r\n",
      "friends could not possibly have wished this beforehand, whatever the Vincys\r\n",
      "might suppose. “Yes, I confess I was surprised.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She never did give me any—not the least in the world, when I talked to her\r\n",
      "myself,” said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. “But when I asked Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "to speak for me, she allowed him to tell me there was a hope.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not yet\r\n",
      "discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for her\r\n",
      "self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the\r\n",
      "disappointments of sadder and wiser people—making a meal of a nightingale and\r\n",
      "never knowing it—and that all the while his family should suppose that hers was\r\n",
      "in eager need of this sprig; and her vexation had fermented the more actively\r\n",
      "because of its total repression towards her husband. Exemplary wives will\r\n",
      "sometimes find scapegoats in this way. She now said with energetic decision,\r\n",
      "“You made a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did I?” said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He was alarmed, but at a loss to\r\n",
      "know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone, “Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I knew, would listen to him\r\n",
      "gravely; and he took it on himself quite readily.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own wishes, and\r\n",
      "seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,” said Mrs. Garth. She did not\r\n",
      "mean to go beyond this salutary general doctrine, and threw her indignation\r\n",
      "into a needless unwinding of her worsted, knitting her brow at it with a grand\r\n",
      "air.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, who\r\n",
      "nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning to form\r\n",
      "themselves.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "as possible.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and then\r\n",
      "turning with a quick movement said almost sharply—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with Mary?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to be\r\n",
      "surprised,” returned Mrs. Garth, laying her knitting down beside her and\r\n",
      "folding her arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her that she should put\r\n",
      "her work out of her hands. In fact her feelings were divided between the\r\n",
      "satisfaction of giving Fred his discipline and the sense of having gone a\r\n",
      "little too far. Fred took his hat and stick and rose quickly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you think I am standing in his way, and in Mary’s too?” he said, in a\r\n",
      "tone which seemed to demand an answer.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She had brought herself into the\r\n",
      "unpleasant position of being called on to say what she really felt, yet what\r\n",
      "she knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her the consciousness\r\n",
      "of having exceeded in words was peculiarly mortifying. Besides, Fred had given\r\n",
      "out unexpected electricity, and he now added, “Mr. Garth seemed pleased that\r\n",
      "Mary should be attached to me. He could not have known anything of this.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her husband, the fear that\r\n",
      "Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily endurable. She answered,\r\n",
      "wanting to check unintended consequences—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything of the\r\n",
      "matter.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she hesitated to beg that he would keep entire silence on a subject which\r\n",
      "she had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop in that way;\r\n",
      "and while she was hesitating there was already a rush of unintended\r\n",
      "consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things stood. Ben, bouncing\r\n",
      "across the grass with Brownie at his heels, and seeing the kitten dragging the\r\n",
      "knitting by a lengthening line of wool, shouted and clapped his hands; Brownie\r\n",
      "barked, the kitten, desperate, jumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then\r\n",
      "jumped down again and swept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up\r\n",
      "the half-knitted sock-top, fitted it over the kitten’s head as a new source of\r\n",
      "madness, while Letty arriving cried out to her mother against this cruelty—it\r\n",
      "was a history as full of sensation as “This is the house that Jack built.” Mrs.\r\n",
      "Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came up and the\r\n",
      "tête-à-tête with Fred was ended. He got away as soon as he could, and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her severity by saying “God\r\n",
      "bless you” when she shook hands with him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was unpleasantly conscious that she had been on the verge of speaking as\r\n",
      "“one of the foolish women speaketh”—telling first and entreating silence after.\r\n",
      "But she had not entreated silence, and to prevent Caleb’s blame she determined\r\n",
      "to blame herself and confess all to him that very night. It was curious what an\r\n",
      "awful tribunal the mild Caleb’s was to her, whenever he set it up. But she\r\n",
      "meant to point out to him that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal\r\n",
      "of good.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No doubt it was having a strong effect on him as he walked to Lowick. Fred’s\r\n",
      "light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise as from this\r\n",
      "suggestion that if he had been out of the way Mary might have made a thoroughly\r\n",
      "good match. Also he was piqued that he had been what he called such a stupid\r\n",
      "lout as to ask that intervention from Mr. Farebrother. But it was not in a\r\n",
      "lover’s nature—it was not in Fred’s, that the new anxiety raised about Mary’s\r\n",
      "feeling should not surmount every other. Notwithstanding his trust in Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother’s generosity, notwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could\r\n",
      "not help feeling that he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he\r\n",
      "objected to it extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her\r\n",
      "good, being ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the\r\n",
      "fighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was much\r\n",
      "more difficult to Fred than the muscular. Certainly this experience was a\r\n",
      "discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his disappointment about his uncle’s\r\n",
      "will. The iron had not entered into his soul, but he had begun to imagine what\r\n",
      "the sharp edge would be. It did not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be\r\n",
      "mistaken about Mr. Farebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about\r\n",
      "Mary. Mary had been staying at the parsonage lately, and her mother might know\r\n",
      "very little of what had been passing in her mind.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not feel easier when he found her looking cheerful with the three ladies\r\n",
      "in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on some subject which was\r\n",
      "dropped when he entered, and Mary was copying the labels from a heap of shallow\r\n",
      "cabinet drawers, in a minute handwriting which she was skilled in. Mr.\r\n",
      "Farebrother was somewhere in the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of\r\n",
      "Fred’s peculiar relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to\r\n",
      "propose that they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself\r\n",
      "that he should have to go away without saying a word to her in private. He told\r\n",
      "her first of Christy’s arrival and then of his own engagement with her father;\r\n",
      "and he was comforted by seeing that this latter news touched her keenly. She\r\n",
      "said hurriedly, “I am so glad,” and then bent over her writing to hinder any\r\n",
      "one from noticing her face. But here was a subject which Mrs. Farebrother could\r\n",
      "not let pass.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a young man\r\n",
      "giving up the Church for which he was educated: you only mean that things being\r\n",
      "so, you are glad that he should be under an excellent man like your father.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,” said Mary, cleverly\r\n",
      "getting rid of one rebellious tear. “I have a dreadfully secular mind. I never\r\n",
      "liked any clergyman except the Vicar of Wakefield and Mr. Farebrother.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now why, my dear?” said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her large wooden\r\n",
      "knitting-needles and looking at Mary. “You have always a good reason for your\r\n",
      "opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the question those who\r\n",
      "preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike clergymen?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear,” said Mary, her face breaking into merriment as she seemed to\r\n",
      "consider a moment, “I don’t like their neckcloths.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you don’t like Camden’s, then,” said Miss Winifred, in some anxiety.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do,” said Mary. “I don’t like the other clergymen’s neckcloths, because\r\n",
      "it is they who wear them.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How very puzzling!” said Miss Noble, feeling that her own intellect was\r\n",
      "probably deficient.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than these for\r\n",
      "slighting so respectable a class of men,” said Mrs. Farebrother, majestically.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is\r\n",
      "difficult to satisfy her,” said Fred.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I am glad at least that she makes an exception in favor of my son,” said\r\n",
      "the old lady.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was wondering at Fred’s piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in and had\r\n",
      "to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the end he said with\r\n",
      "quiet satisfaction, “That is right;” and then bent to look at Mary’s\r\n",

      "that he should know until it was late enough not to signify to her. The\r\n",
      "temptation was certainly great: she was very fond of the exercise, and the\r\n",
      "gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir Godwin’s\r\n",
      "son, on another fine horse by her side, and of being met in this position by\r\n",

      "her own tastes and interests: she had seen clearly Lydgate’s preeminence in\r\n",
      "Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively tracing still more agreeable\r\n",
      "social effects when his talent should have advanced him; but for her, his\r\n",
      "professional and scientific ambition had no other relation to these desirable\r\n",
      "effects than if they had been the fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil.\r\n",
      "And that oil apart, with which she had nothing to do, of course she believed in\r\n",
      "her own opinion more than she did in his. Lydgate was astounded to find in\r\n",
      "numberless trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the\r\n",
      "riding, that affection did not make her compliant. He had no doubt that the\r\n",
      "affection was there, and had no presentiment that he had done anything to repel\r\n",
      "it. For his own part he said to himself that he loved her as tenderly as ever,\r\n",
      "and could make up his mind to her negations; but—well! Lydgate was much\r\n",
      "worried, and conscious of new elements in his life as noxious to him as an\r\n",
      "inlet of mud to a creature that has been used to breathe and bathe and dart\r\n",
      "after its illuminated prey in the clearest of waters.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her worktable, enjoying drives\r\n",
      "in her father’s phaeton and thinking it likely that she might be invited to\r\n",
      "Quallingham. She knew that she was a much more exquisite ornament to the\r\n",
      "drawing-room there than any daughter of the family, and in reflecting that the\r\n",
      "gentlemen were aware of that, did not perhaps sufficiently consider whether the\r\n",
      "ladies would be eager to see themselves surpassed.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her, relapsed into what she inwardly\r\n",
      "called his moodiness—a name which to her covered his thoughtful preoccupation\r\n",
      "with other subjects than herself, as well as that uneasy look of the brow and\r\n",
      "distaste for all ordinary things as if they were mixed with bitter herbs, which\r\n",
      "really made a sort of weather-glass to his vexation and foreboding. These\r\n",
      "latter states of mind had one cause amongst others, which he had generously but\r\n",
      "mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her health and\r\n",
      "spirits. Between him and her indeed there was that total missing of each\r\n",
      "other’s mental track, which is too evidently possible even between persons who\r\n",
      "are continually thinking of each other. To Lydgate it seemed that he had been\r\n",
      "spending month after month in sacrificing more than half of his best intent and\r\n",
      "best power to his tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her little claims and\r\n",
      "interruptions without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of\r\n",
      "bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the blank\r\n",
      "unreflecting surface her mind presented to his ardor for the more impersonal\r\n",
      "ends of his profession and his scientific study, an ardor which he had fancied\r\n",
      "that the ideal wife must somehow worship as sublime, though not in the least\r\n",
      "knowing why. But his endurance was mingled with a self-discontent which, if we\r\n",
      "know how to be candid, we shall confess to make more than half our bitterness\r\n",
      "under grievances, wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we\r\n",
      "had been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate\r\n",
      "was aware that his concessions to Rosamond were often little more than the\r\n",
      "lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize an\r\n",
      "enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our lives. And\r\n",
      "on Lydgate’s enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a simple weight of\r\n",
      "sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading care, such as casts the\r\n",
      "blight of irony over all higher effort.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the care which he had hitherto abstained from mentioning to Rosamond;\r\n",
      "and he believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered her mind, though\r\n",
      "certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It was an inference with a\r\n",
      "conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily drawn by indifferent observers,\r\n",
      "that Lydgate was in debt; and he could not succeed in keeping out of his mind\r\n",
      "for long together that he was every day getting deeper into that swamp, which\r\n",
      "tempts men towards it with such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is\r\n",
      "wonderful how soon a man gets up to his chin there—in a condition in which, in\r\n",
      "spite of himself, he is forced to think chiefly of release, though he had a\r\n",
      "scheme of the universe in his soul.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager want of\r\n",
      "small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who descended a step\r\n",
      "in order to gain them. He was now experiencing something worse than a simple\r\n",
      "deficit: he was assailed by the vulgar hateful trials of a man who has bought\r\n",
      "and used a great many things which might have been done without, and which he\r\n",
      "is unable to pay for, though the demand for payment has become pressing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or knowledge of\r\n",
      "prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing for marriage finds that\r\n",
      "his furniture and other initial expenses come to between four and five hundred\r\n",
      "pounds more than he has capital to pay for; when at the end of a year it\r\n",
      "appears that his household expenses, horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a\r\n",
      "thousand, while the proceeds of the practice reckoned from the old books to be\r\n",
      "worth eight hundred per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five\r\n",
      "hundred, chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he\r\n",
      "minds it or not, he is in debt. Those were less expensive times than our own,\r\n",
      "and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease with which a medical\r\n",
      "man who had lately bought a practice, who thought that he was obliged to keep\r\n",
      "two horses, whose table was supplied without stint, and who paid an insurance\r\n",
      "on his life and a high rent for house and garden, might find his expenses\r\n",
      "doubling his receipts, can be conceived by any one who does not think these\r\n",
      "details beneath his consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her childhood to\r\n",
      "an extravagant household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply in\r\n",
      "ordering the best of everything—nothing else “answered;” and Lydgate supposed\r\n",
      "that “if things were done at all, they must be done properly”—he did not see\r\n",
      "how they were to live otherwise. If each head of household expenditure had been\r\n",
      "mentioned to him beforehand, he would have probably observed that “it could\r\n",
      "hardly come to much,” and if any one had suggested a saving on a particular\r\n",
      "article—for example, the substitution of cheap fish for dear—it would have\r\n",
      "appeared to him simply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such\r\n",
      "an occasion as Captain Lydgate’s visit, was fond of giving invitations, and\r\n",
      "Lydgate, though he often thought the guests tiresome, did not interfere. This\r\n",
      "sociability seemed a necessary part of professional prudence, and the\r\n",
      "entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate was constantly visiting the\r\n",
      "homes of the poor and adjusting his prescriptions of diet to their small means;\r\n",
      "but, dear me! has it not by this time ceased to be remarkable—is it not rather\r\n",
      "that we expect in men, that they should have numerous strands of experience\r\n",
      "lying side by side and never compare them with each other? Expenditure—like\r\n",
      "ugliness and errors—becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own\r\n",
      "personality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is manifest (in\r\n",
      "our own sensations) between ourselves and others. Lydgate believed himself to\r\n",
      "be careless about his dress, and he despised a man who calculated the effects\r\n",
      "of his costume; it seemed to him only a matter of course that he had abundance\r\n",
      "of fresh garments—such things were naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be\r\n",
      "remembered that he had never hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and\r\n",
      "he walked by habit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Its novelty made it the more irritating. He was amazed, disgusted that\r\n",
      "conditions so foreign to all his purposes, so hatefully disconnected with the\r\n",
      "objects he cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in ambush and\r\n",
      "clutched him when he was unaware. And there was not only the actual debt; there\r\n",
      "was the certainty that in his present position he must go on deepening it. Two\r\n",
      "furnishing tradesmen at Brassing, whose bills had been incurred before his\r\n",
      "marriage, and whom uncalculated current expenses had ever since prevented him\r\n",
      "from paying, had repeatedly sent him unpleasant letters which had forced\r\n",
      "themselves on his attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any\r\n",
      "disposition than to Lydgate’s, with his intense pride—his dislike of asking a\r\n",
      "favor or being under an obligation to any one. He had scorned even to form\r\n",
      "conjectures about Mr. Vincy’s intentions on money matters, and nothing but\r\n",
      "extremity could have induced him to apply to his father-in-law, even if he had\r\n",
      "not been made aware in various indirect ways since his marriage that Mr.\r\n",
      "Vincy’s own affairs were not flourishing, and that the expectation of help from\r\n",
      "him would be resented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it\r\n",
      "had never in the former part of his life occurred to Lydgate that he should\r\n",
      "need to do so: he had never thought what borrowing would be to him; but now\r\n",
      "that the idea had entered his mind, he felt that he would rather incur any\r\n",
      "other hardship. In the mean time he had no money or prospects of money; and his\r\n",
      "practice was not getting more lucrative.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward trouble\r\n",
      "during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining brilliant\r\n",
      "health, he meditated taking her entirely into confidence on his difficulties.\r\n",
      "New conversance with tradesmen’s bills had forced his reasoning into a new\r\n",
      "channel of comparison: he had begun to consider from a new point of view what\r\n",
      "was necessary and unnecessary in goods ordered, and to see that there must be\r\n",
      "some change of habits. How could such a change be made without Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "concurrence? The immediate occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her was\r\n",
      "forced upon him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security could\r\n",
      "possibly be given by a man in his position, Lydgate had offered the one good\r\n",
      "security in his power to the less peremptory creditor, who was a silversmith\r\n",
      "and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself the upholsterer’s credit\r\n",
      "also, accepting interest for a given term. The security necessary was a bill of\r\n",
      "sale on the furniture of his house, which might make a creditor easy for a\r\n",
      "reasonable time about a debt amounting to less than four hundred pounds; and\r\n",
      "the silversmith, Mr. Dover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion\r\n",
      "of the plate and any other article which was as good as new. “Any other\r\n",
      "article” was a phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more particularly some\r\n",
      "purple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate had bought as a bridal\r\n",
      "present.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Opinions may be divided as to his wisdom in making this present: some may think\r\n",
      "that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man like Lydgate, and\r\n",
      "that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in the pinched narrowness of\r\n",
      "provincial life at that time, which offered no conveniences for professional\r\n",
      "people whose fortune was not proportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "ridiculous fastidiousness about asking his friends for money.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him on that fine morning when\r\n",
      "he went to give a final order for plate: in the presence of other jewels\r\n",
      "enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of which the amount had not\r\n",
      "been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for ornaments so exquisitely suited to\r\n",
      "Rosamond’s neck and arms could hardly appear excessive when there was no ready\r\n",
      "cash for it to exceed. But at this crisis Lydgate’s imagination could not help\r\n",
      "dwelling on the possibility of letting the amethysts take their place again\r\n",
      "among Mr. Dover’s stock, though he shrank from the idea of proposing this to\r\n",
      "Rosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he had never been in\r\n",
      "the habit of tracing, he was preparing to act on this discernment with some of\r\n",
      "the rigor (by no means all) that he would have applied in pursuing experiment.\r\n",
      "He was nerving himself to this rigor as he rode from Brassing, and meditated on\r\n",
      "the representations he must make to Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evening when he got home. He was intensely miserable, this strong man of\r\n",
      "nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He was not saying angrily within himself\r\n",
      "that he had made a profound mistake; but the mistake was at work in him like a\r\n",
      "recognized chronic disease, mingling its uneasy importunities with every\r\n",
      "prospect, and enfeebling every thought. As he went along the passage to the\r\n",
      "drawing-room, he heard the piano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It\r\n",
      "was some weeks since Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he was still at the old\r\n",
      "post in Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw’s coming,\r\n",
      "but just now he was annoyed that he could not find his hearth free. When he\r\n",
      "opened the door the two singers went on towards the key-note, raising their\r\n",
      "eyes and looking at him indeed, but not regarding his entrance as an\r\n",
      "interruption. To a man galled with his harness as poor Lydgate was, it is not\r\n",
      "soothing to see two people warbling at him, as he comes in with the sense that\r\n",
      "the painful day has still pains in store. His face, already paler than usual,\r\n",
      "took on a scowl as he walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only three\r\n",
      "bars to sing, now turned round.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you, Lydgate?” said Will, coming forward to shake hands.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate took his hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,” said Rosamond, who had\r\n",
      "already seen that her husband was in a “horrible humor.” She seated herself in\r\n",
      "her usual place as she spoke.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have dined. I should like some tea, please,” said Lydgate, curtly, still\r\n",
      "scowling and looking markedly at his legs stretched out before him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was too quick to need more. “I shall be off,” he said, reaching his hat.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Lydgate is bored,” said Will, who had more comprehension of Lydgate than\r\n",

      "causes of annoyance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is the more need for you to stay,” said Rosamond, playfully, and in her\r\n",
      "lightest accent; “he will not speak to me all the evening.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Rosamond, I shall,” said Lydgate, in his strong baritone. “I have some\r\n",
      "serious business to speak to you about.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No introduction of the business could have been less like that which Lydgate\r\n",
      "had intended; but her indifferent manner had been too provoking.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There! you see,” said Will. “I’m going to the meeting about the Mechanics’\r\n",
      "Institute. Good-by;” and he went quickly out of the room.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond did not look at her husband, but presently rose and took her place\r\n",
      "before the tea-tray. She was thinking that she had never seen him so\r\n",
      "disagreeable. Lydgate turned his dark eyes on her and watched her as she\r\n",
      "delicately handled the tea-service with her taper fingers, and looked at the\r\n",
      "objects immediately before her with no curve in her face disturbed, and yet\r\n",
      "with an ineffable protest in her air against all people with unpleasant\r\n",
      "manners. For the moment he lost the sense of his wound in a sudden speculation\r\n",
      "about this new form of feminine impassibility revealing itself in the\r\n",
      "sylph-like frame which he had once interpreted as the sign of a ready\r\n",
      "intelligent sensitiveness. His mind glancing back to Laure while he looked at\r\n",
      "Rosamond, he said inwardly, “Would she kill me because I wearied her?”\r\n",
      "and then, “It is the way with all women.” But this power of generalizing which\r\n",
      "gives men so much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was\r\n",
      "immediately thwarted by Lydgate’s memory of wondering impressions from the\r\n",
      "behavior of another woman—from Dorothea’s looks and tones of emotion about her\r\n",
      "husband when Lydgate began to attend him—from her passionate cry to be taught\r\n",
      "what would best comfort that man for whose sake it seemed as if she must quell\r\n",
      "every impulse in her except the yearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These\r\n",
      "revived impressions succeeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate’s mind\r\n",
      "while the tea was being brewed. He had shut his eyes in the last instant of\r\n",
      "reverie while he heard Dorothea saying, “Advise me—think what I can do—he has\r\n",
      "been all his life laboring and looking forward. He minds about nothing else—and\r\n",
      "I mind about nothing else.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him as the enkindling\r\n",
      "conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within him (is there not a\r\n",
      "genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over human spirits and their\r\n",
      "conclusions?); the tones were a music from which he was falling away—he had\r\n",
      "really fallen into a momentary doze, when Rosamond said in her silvery neutral\r\n",
      "way, “Here is your tea, Tertius,” setting it on the small table by his side,\r\n",
      "and then moved back to her place without looking at him. Lydgate was too hasty\r\n",
      "in attributing insensibility to her; after her own fashion, she was sensitive\r\n",
      "enough, and took lasting impressions. Her impression now was one of offence and\r\n",
      "repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had never raised her voice: she\r\n",
      "was quite sure that no one could justly find fault with her.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps Lydgate and she had never felt so far off each other before; but there\r\n",
      "were strong reasons for not deferring his revelation, even if he had not\r\n",
      "already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of the angry desire\r\n",
      "to rouse her into more sensibility on his account which had prompted him to\r\n",
      "speak prematurely, still mingled with his pain in the prospect of her pain. But\r\n",
      "he waited till the tray was gone, the candles were lit, and the evening quiet\r\n",
      "might be counted on: the interval had left time for repelled tenderness to\r\n",
      "return into the old course. He spoke kindly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,” he said, gently, pushing\r\n",
      "away the table, and stretching out his arm to draw a chair near his own.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond obeyed. As she came towards him in her drapery of transparent faintly\r\n",
      "tinted muslin, her slim yet round figure never looked more graceful; as she sat\r\n",
      "down by him and laid one hand on the elbow of his chair, at last looking at him\r\n",
      "and meeting his eyes, her delicate neck and cheek and purely cut lips never had\r\n",
      "more of that untarnished beauty which touches as in spring-time and infancy and\r\n",
      "all sweet freshness. It touched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of\r\n",
      "his love for her with all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis\r\n",
      "of deep trouble. He laid his ample hand softly on hers, saying—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear!” with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.\r\n",
      "Rosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her husband was\r\n",
      "still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred delight. She put his hair\r\n",
      "lightly away from his forehead, then laid her other hand on his, and was\r\n",
      "conscious of forgiving him.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are things which\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were married,\r\n",
      "and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged to meet. The\r\n",
      "consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing—three hundred and eighty\r\n",
      "pounds—which has been pressing on me a good while, and in fact we are getting\r\n",
      "deeper every day, for people don’t pay me the faster because others want the\r\n",
      "money. I took pains to keep it from you while you were not well; but now we\r\n",
      "must think together about it, and you must help me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can I do, Tertius?” said Rosamond, turning her eyes on him again.\r\n",
      "That little speech of four words, like so many others in all languages, is\r\n",
      "capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all states of mind from\r\n",
      "helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative perception, from the completest\r\n",
      "self-devoting fellowship to the most neutral aloofness. Rosamond’s thin\r\n",
      "utterance threw into the words “What can—I—do!” as much neutrality as they\r\n",
      "could hold. They fell like a mortal chill on Lydgate’s roused tenderness. He\r\n",
      "did not storm in indignation—he felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when\r\n",
      "he spoke again it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to fulfil a\r\n",
      "task.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a time,\r\n",
      "and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond colored deeply. “Have you not asked papa for money?” she said, as soon\r\n",
      "as she could speak.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "to stand at two yards’ distance from him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Rosy,” said Lydgate, decisively. “It is too late to do that. The inventory\r\n",
      "will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it will make no\r\n",
      "difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it that your father shall\r\n",
      "not know, unless I choose to tell him,” added Lydgate, with a more peremptory\r\n",
      "emphasis.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him back on evil expectation\r\n",
      "as to what she would do in the way of quiet steady disobedience. The unkindness\r\n",
      "seemed unpardonable to her: she was not given to weeping and disliked it, but\r\n",
      "now her chin and lips began to tremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was\r\n",
      "not possible for Lydgate, under the double stress of outward material\r\n",
      "difficulty and of his own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to\r\n",
      "imagine fully what this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known\r\n",
      "nothing but indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more\r\n",
      "exactly to her taste. But he did wish to spare her as much as he could, and her\r\n",
      "tears cut him to the heart. He could not speak again immediately; but Rosamond\r\n",
      "did not go on sobbing: she tried to conquer her agitation and wiped away her\r\n",
      "tears, continuing to look before her at the mantel-piece.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Try not to grieve, darling,” said Lydgate, turning his eyes up towards her.\r\n",
      "That she had chosen to move away from him in this moment of her trouble made\r\n",
      "everything harder to say, but he must absolutely go on. “We must brace\r\n",
      "ourselves to do what is necessary. It is I who have been in fault: I ought to\r\n",
      "have seen that I could not afford to live in this way. But many things have\r\n",
      "told against me in my practice, and it really just now has ebbed to a low\r\n",
      "point. I may recover it, but in the mean time we must pull up—we must change\r\n",
      "our way of living. We shall weather it. When I have given this security I shall\r\n",
      "have time to look about me; and you are so clever that if you turn your mind to\r\n",
      "managing you will school me into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal\r\n",
      "about squaring prices—but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was bowing his neck under the yoke like a creature who had talons, but\r\n",
      "who had Reason too, which often reduces us to meekness. When he had spoken the\r\n",
      "last words in an imploring tone, Rosamond returned to the chair by his side.\r\n",
      "His self-blame gave her some hope that he would attend to her opinion, and she\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not send them away,” said Lydgate, the peremptoriness rising again.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and that would do as\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "proper representations to them.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is idle Rosamond,” said Lydgate, angrily. “You must learn to take my\r\n",
      "judgment on questions you don’t understand. I have made necessary arrangements,\r\n",
      "and they must be carried out. As to friends, I have no expectations whatever\r\n",
      "from them, and shall not ask them for anything.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her mind was that if she had known\r\n",
      "how Lydgate would behave, she would never have married him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,” said Lydgate, trying\r\n",
      "to be gentle again. “There are some details that I want to consider with you.\r\n",
      "Dover says he will take a good deal of the plate back again, and any of the\r\n",
      "jewellery we like. He really behaves very well.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are we to go without spoons and forks then?” said Rosamond, whose very lips\r\n",
      "seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her utterance. She was determined to\r\n",
      "make no further resistance or suggestions.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, dear!” said Lydgate. “But look here,” he continued, drawing a paper\r\n",
      "from his pocket and opening it; “here is Dover’s account. See, I have marked a\r\n",
      "number of articles, which if we returned them would reduce the amount by thirty\r\n",
      "pounds and more. I have not marked any of the jewellery.” Lydgate had really\r\n",
      "felt this point of the jewellery very bitter to himself; but he had overcome\r\n",
      "the feeling by severe argument. He could not propose to Rosamond that she\r\n",
      "should return any particular present of his, but he had told himself that he\r\n",
      "was bound to put Dover’s offer before her, and her inward prompting might make\r\n",
      "the affair easy.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is useless for me to look, Tertius,” said Rosamond, calmly; “you will\r\n",
      "return what you please.” She would not turn her eyes on the paper, and Lydgate,\r\n",
      "flushing up to the roots of his hair, drew it back and let it fall on his knee.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of the room, leaving Lydgate helpless and\r\n",
      "wondering. Was she not coming back? It seemed that she had no more identified\r\n",
      "herself with him than if they had been creatures of different species and\r\n",
      "opposing interests. He tossed his head and thrust his hands deep into his\r\n",
      "pockets with a sort of vengeance. There was still science—there were still good\r\n",
      "objects to work for. He must give a tug still—all the stronger because other\r\n",
      "satisfactions were going.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She carried the leather box\r\n",
      "containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which contained other\r\n",
      "boxes, and laying them on the chair where she had been sitting, she said, with\r\n",
      "perfect propriety in her air—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you like of\r\n",
      "it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me to stay at home\r\n",
      "to-morrow. I shall go to papa’s.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To many women the look Lydgate cast at her would have been more terrible than\r\n",
      "one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the distance she was\r\n",
      "placing between them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And when shall you come back again?” he said, with a bitter edge on his\r\n",
      "accent.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to mamma.”\r\n",
      "Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more irreproachably than she\r\n",
      "was behaving; and she went to sit down at her work-table. Lydgate sat\r\n",
      "meditating a minute or two, and the result was that he said, with some of the\r\n",
      "old emotion in his tone—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in the first\r\n",
      "trouble that has come.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly not,” said Rosamond; “I shall do everything it becomes me to do.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not right that the thing should be left to servants, or that I should\r\n",
      "have to speak to them about it. And I shall be obliged to go out—I don’t know\r\n",
      "how early. I understand your shrinking from the humiliation of these money\r\n",
      "affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a question of pride, which I feel just as\r\n",
      "much as you can, it is surely better to manage the thing ourselves, and let the\r\n",
      "servants see as little of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is\r\n",
      "no hindering your share in my disgraces—if there were disgraces.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she said, “Very well, I will\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I will write\r\n",

      "once.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "of sarcasm.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the ink, I\r\n",

      "where he meant to write.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table was\r\n",

      "“Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a time, I\r\n",

      "manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an inexperienced girl has\r\n",
      "got into trouble by marrying him. She received his kiss and returned it\r\n",
      "faintly, and in this way an appearance of accord was recovered for the time.\r\n",

      "among the ladies on the news which their old servant had got from Tantripp\r\n",
      "concerning Mr. Casaubon’s strange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his\r\n",

      "her brother had known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most\r\n",

      "said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of spiders,\r\n",

      "news had something to do with their having only once seen Mr. Ladislaw at\r\n",
      "Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small compassionate mewings.\r\n",

      "going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to say to each other now that marriage\r\n",
      "had removed her from collision with the unpleasantness of brothers, and\r\n",
      "especially now that he had taken what she held the stupid and even\r\n",
      "reprehensible step of giving up the Church to take to such a business as Mr.\r\n",

      "his conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He imagined that there was a\r\n",
      "passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck him as much too serious to\r\n",
      "gossip about. He remembered Will’s irritability when he had mentioned Mrs.\r\n",
      "Casaubon, and was the more circumspect. On the whole his surmises, in addition\r\n",
      "to what he knew of the fact, increased his friendliness and tolerance towards\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, and made him understand the vacillation which kept him at Middlemarch\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and foreseeing\r\n",

      "no one who would so much like to marry her as a certain gentleman; and then\r\n",
      "laying a plan to spoil all by making her forfeit her property if she did marry\r\n",

      "in women’s minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy, referring to\r\n",
      "no real claims, springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of\r\n",
      "egoism, and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech. “There really is\r\n",

      "home would tease her about expenses. She had already secretly disobeyed him by\r\n",
      "asking her father to help them, and he had ended decisively by saying, “I am\r\n",
      "more likely to want help myself.”\r\n",

      "A few days afterwards—it was already the end of August—there was an occasion\r\n",
      "which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it chose, was to\r\n",
      "have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished auspices of Mr. Borthrop\r\n",
      "Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures which anybody might see by the\r\n",
      "handbills to be the best in every kind, belonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq. This\r\n",
      "was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade; on the contrary,\r\n",
      "it was due to Mr. Larcher’s great success in the carrying business, which\r\n",
      "warranted his purchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high\r\n",
      "style by an illustrious Spa physician—furnished indeed with such large\r\n",
      "framefuls of expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs. Larcher was\r\n",
      "nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be Scriptural. Hence the\r\n",
      "fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of\r\n",
      "Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him\r\n",
      "to state that the hall furniture, to be sold without reserve, comprised a piece\r\n",
      "of carving by a contemporary of Gibbons.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival.\r\n",
      "There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at a superior funeral;\r\n",
      "and facilities were offered for that generous-drinking of cheerful glasses\r\n",
      "which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr.\r\n",
      "Larcher’s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house\r\n",
      "stood just at the end of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that\r\n",
      "pleasant issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road\r\n",
      "to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode’s retired residence, known as the\r\n",
      "Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all classes with\r\n",
      "leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in order simply to raise\r\n",
      "prices, it was almost equal to betting at the races. The second day, when the\r\n",
      "best furniture was to be sold, “everybody” was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the\r\n",
      "rector of St. Peter’s, had looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the\r\n",
      "carved table, and had rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There\r\n",
      "was a wreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large\r\n",
      "table in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with desk and\r\n",
      "hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by\r\n",
      "incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow-window opening on\r\n",
      "to the lawn.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Everybody” that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could not well\r\n",
      "endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had particularly wished to have\r\n",
      "a certain picture—a “Supper at Emmaus,” attributed in the catalogue to Guido;\r\n",
      "and at the last moment before the day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at\r\n",
      "the office of the “Pioneer,” of which he was now one of the proprietors, to beg\r\n",
      "of Mr. Ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable\r\n",
      "knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the value of\r\n",
      "this particular painting—“if,” added the scrupulously polite banker,\r\n",
      "“attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your\r\n",
      "departure, which I know is imminent.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will’s ear if he had been\r\n",
      "in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an understanding entered\r\n",
      "into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper, that he should be at\r\n",
      "liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he\r\n",
      "had been training; since he wished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite\r\n",
      "visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or\r\n",
      "beguilingly agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve\r\n",
      "when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such states of\r\n",
      "mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle:\r\n",
      "impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled, still—very wonderful\r\n",
      "things have happened! Will did not confess this weakness to himself, but he\r\n",
      "lingered. What was the use of going to London at that time of the year? The\r\n",
      "Rugby men who would remember him were not there; and so far as political\r\n",
      "writing was concerned, he would rather for a few weeks go on with the\r\n",
      "“Pioneer.” At the present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to\r\n",
      "him, he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not\r\n",
      "to go till he had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he replied that he had reasons\r\n",
      "for deferring his departure a little, and would be happy to go to the sale.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will was in a defiant mood, his consciousness being deeply stung with the\r\n",
      "thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an\r\n",
      "accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated\r\n",
      "by a disposal of property. Like most people who assert their freedom with\r\n",
      "regard to conventional distinction, he was prepared to be sudden and quick at\r\n",
      "quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that\r\n",
      "assertion—that there was anything in his blood, his bearing, or his character\r\n",
      "to which he gave the mask of an opinion. When he was under an irritating\r\n",
      "impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look, the\r\n",
      "color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive,\r\n",
      "watching for something which he had to dart upon.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale, and those who had\r\n",
      "only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have\r\n",
      "been struck with a contrast. He was not sorry to have this occasion for\r\n",
      "appearing in public before the Middlemarch tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the\r\n",
      "rest, who looked down on him as an adventurer, and were in a state of brutal\r\n",
      "ignorance about Dante—who sneered at his Polish blood, and were themselves of a\r\n",
      "breed very much in need of crossing. He stood in a conspicuous place not far\r\n",
      "from the auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his head thrown\r\n",
      "backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he had been cordially welcomed\r\n",
      "as a connoissure by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the utmost activity\r\n",
      "of his great faculties.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers\r\n",
      "of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to\r\n",
      "his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge. Some saturnine,\r\n",
      "sour-blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of\r\n",
      "all articles from boot-jacks to “Berghems;” but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a\r\n",
      "kindly liquid in his veins; he was an admirer by nature, and would have liked\r\n",
      "to have the universe under his hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher\r\n",
      "figure for his recommendation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher’s drawing-room furniture was enough for him. When Will\r\n",
      "Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been forgotten in its right\r\n",
      "place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer’s enthusiasm, which he distributed on\r\n",
      "the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need\r\n",
      "of praise. The fender was of polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work\r\n",
      "and a sharp edge.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, ladies,” said he, “I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which at any\r\n",
      "other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I may say, for\r\n",
      "quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of thing”—here Mr. Trumbull\r\n",
      "dropped his voice and became slightly nasal, trimming his outlines with his\r\n",
      "left finger—“that might not fall in with ordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you\r\n",
      "that by-and-by this style of workmanship will be the only one in\r\n",
      "vogue—half-a-crown, you said? thank you—going at half-a-crown, this\r\n",
      "characteristic fender; and I have particular information that the antique style\r\n",
      "is very much sought after in high quarters. Three\r\n",
      "shillings—three-and-sixpence—hold it well up, Joseph! Look, ladies, at the\r\n",
      "chastity of the design—I have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the\r\n",
      "last century! Four shillings, Mr. Mawmsey?—four shillings.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not a thing I would put in my drawing-room,” said Mrs. Mawmsey,\r\n",
      "audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. “I wonder at Mrs. Larcher.\r\n",
      "Every blessed child’s head that fell against it would be cut in two. The edge\r\n",
      "is like a knife.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite true,” rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, “and most uncommonly useful to\r\n",
      "have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather shoe-tie or a bit of\r\n",
      "string that wants cutting and no knife at hand: many a man has been left\r\n",
      "hanging because there was no knife to cut him down. Gentlemen, here’s a fender\r\n",
      "that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no\r\n",
      "time—with astonishing celerity—four-and-sixpence—five—five-and-sixpence—an\r\n",
      "appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest\r\n",
      "a little out of his mind—six shillings—thank you, Mr. Clintup—going at six\r\n",
      "shillings—going—gone!” The auctioneer’s glance, which had been searching round\r\n",
      "him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of bidding, here dropped\r\n",
      "on the paper before him, and his voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent\r\n",
      "despatch as he said, “Mr. Clintup. Be handy, Joseph.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke\r\n",
      "on,” said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his next neighbor. He\r\n",
      "was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and feared that the audience\r\n",
      "might regard his bid as a foolish one.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. “Now, ladies,” said\r\n",
      "Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, “this tray contains a very\r\n",
      "recherchy lot—a collection of trifles for the drawing-room table—and trifles\r\n",
      "make the sum of human things—nothing more important than trifles—(yes,\r\n",
      "Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by)—but pass the tray round, Joseph—these bijoux must\r\n",
      "be examined, ladies. This I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance—a sort\r\n",
      "of practical rebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant\r\n",
      "heart-shaped box, portable—for the pocket; there, again, it becomes like a\r\n",
      "splendid double flower—an ornament for the table; and now”—Mr. Trumbull allowed\r\n",
      "the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart-shaped leaves—“a book of\r\n",
      "riddles! No less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I\r\n",
      "had less of a conscience, I should not wish you to bid high for this lot—I have\r\n",
      "a longing for it myself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue,\r\n",
      "more than a good riddle?—it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to the\r\n",
      "society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without the elegant\r\n",
      "domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high price to the lot.\r\n",
      "Carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society. Four\r\n",
      "shillings, sir?—four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with\r\n",
      "the et caeteras. Here is a sample: ‘How must you spell honey to make it catch\r\n",
      "lady-birds? Answer—money.’ You hear?—lady-birds—honey money. This is an\r\n",
      "amusement to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting—it has what we call satire,\r\n",
      "and wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence—five shillings.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and this was\r\n",
      "too exasperating. Bowyer couldn’t afford it, and only wanted to hinder every\r\n",
      "other man from making a figure. The current carried even Mr. Horrock with it,\r\n",
      "but this committal of himself to an opinion fell from him with so little\r\n",
      "sacrifice of his neutral expression, that the bid might not have been detected\r\n",
      "as his but for the friendly oaths of Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what\r\n",
      "Horrock would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to\r\n",
      "that state of perdition which the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the\r\n",
      "majority of earthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to\r\n",
      "Mr. Spilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless with his\r\n",
      "pocket-money and felt his want of memory for riddles.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Trumbull, this is too bad—you’ve been putting some old maid’s rubbish\r\n",
      "into the sale,” murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the auctioneer. “I want\r\n",
      "to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Immediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which your\r\n",
      "noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints—Lot 235. Now,\r\n",
      "gentlemen, you who are connoissures, you are going to have a treat. Here\r\n",
      "is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by his staff on the Field\r\n",
      "of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which have, as it were,\r\n",
      "enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be bold to say—for a man in my line\r\n",
      "must not be blown about by political winds—that a finer subject—of the modern\r\n",
      "order, belonging to our own time and epoch—the understanding of man could\r\n",
      "hardly conceive: angels might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who painted it?” said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell—the painter is not known,”\r\n",
      "answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last words, after which he\r\n",
      "pursed up his lips and stared round him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion, as of a\r\n",
      "man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or pity, nobody raised\r\n",
      "the price on him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and after he\r\n",
      "had secured them he went away. Other prints, and afterwards some paintings,\r\n",
      "were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a special desire for\r\n",
      "them, and there was a more active movement of the audience in and out; some,\r\n",
      "who had bought what they wanted, going away, others coming in either quite\r\n",
      "newly or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread under the\r\n",
      "marquee on the lawn. It was this marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying,\r\n",
      "and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its\r\n",
      "possession. On the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring\r\n",
      "with him a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else, whose\r\n",
      "appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the\r\n",
      "horse-dealer’s—also “given to indulgence.” His large whiskers, imposing\r\n",
      "swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking figure; but his suit of\r\n",
      "black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the prejudicial inference that he was\r\n",
      "not able to afford himself as much indulgence as he liked.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is it you’ve picked up, Bam?” said Mr. Horrock, aside.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ask him yourself,” returned Mr. Bambridge. “He said he’d just turned in from\r\n",
      "the road.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his stick with one\r\n",
      "hand, using his toothpick with the other, and looking about him with a certain\r\n",
      "restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on him by circumstances.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the “Supper at Emmaus” was brought forward, to Will’s immense relief,\r\n",
      "for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had drawn back a little\r\n",
      "and leaned his shoulder against the wall just behind the auctioneer. He now\r\n",
      "came forward again, and his eye caught the conspicuous stranger, who, rather to\r\n",
      "his surprise, was staring at him markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to\r\n",
      "by Mr. Trumbull.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoissure, I think.\r\n",
      "It is some pleasure,” the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor, “to have a\r\n",
      "picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen—a picture worth\r\n",
      "any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment. It is a\r\n",
      "painting of the Italian school—by the celebrated Guydo, the greatest\r\n",
      "painter in the world, the chief of the Old Masters, as they are called—I take\r\n",
      "it, because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us—in possession of\r\n",
      "secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have\r\n",
      "seen a great many pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this\r\n",
      "mark—some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects. But\r\n",
      "here is a Guydo—the frame alone is worth pounds—which any lady might be\r\n",
      "proud to hang up—a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable\r\n",
      "institution, if any gentleman of the Corporation wished to show his\r\n",
      "munificence. Turn it a little, sir? yes. Joseph, turn it a little\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Ladislaw—Mr. Ladislaw, having been abroad, understands the merit of\r\n",
      "these things, you observe.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, “Five\r\n",
      "pounds.” The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and gentlemen, for the\r\n",
      "credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art\r\n",
      "has been amongst us in this town, and nobody in Middlemarch awake to it. Five\r\n",
      "guineas—five seven-six—five ten. Still, ladies, still! It is a gem, and ‘Full\r\n",
      "many a gem,’ as the poet says, has been allowed to go at a nominal price\r\n",
      "because the public knew no better, because it was offered in circles where\r\n",
      "there was—I was going to say a low feeling, but no!—Six pounds—six guineas—a\r\n",
      "Guydo of the first order going at six guineas—it is an insult to\r\n",
      "religion, ladies; it touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a subject\r\n",
      "like this should go at such a low figure—six pounds ten—seven—”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it, remembering that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture, and thinking that he might stretch\r\n",
      "the price to twelve pounds. But it was knocked down to him at ten guineas,\r\n",
      "whereupon he pushed his way towards the bow-window and went out. He chose to go\r\n",
      "under the marquee to get a glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty\r\n",
      "of other visitors, and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh\r\n",
      "water; but before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid\r\n",
      "stranger who had stared at him. It struck Will at this moment that the man\r\n",
      "might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had\r\n",
      "once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on the\r\n",
      "Reform question, and who might think of getting a shilling by news. In this\r\n",

      "acquaintance Mr. Raffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling\r\n",
      "observation, if it suited his purpose to do so. He moved a step or two till he\r\n",
      "was in front of Will, and said with full-mouthed haste, “Excuse me, Mr.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was in Will’s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct answer\r\n",
      "of the question and a challenge of the consequences. To have said, “What is\r\n",
      "that to you?” in the first instance, would have seemed like shuffling—as if he\r\n",
      "minded who knew anything about his origin!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which was\r\n",
      "implied in Ladislaw’s threatening air. The slim young fellow with his girl’s\r\n",
      "complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to spring on him. Under such\r\n",

      "Hereupon Raffles, who had lifted his hat with the last words, turned himself\r\n",
      "round with a swing of his leg and walked away. Will looked after him a moment,\r\n",
      "and could see that he did not re-enter the auction-room, but appeared to be\r\n",
      "walking towards the road. For an instant he thought that he had been foolish\r\n",

      "intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity, greeted him jovially and walked\r\n",
      "by his side, remarking at first on the pleasantness of the town and\r\n",

      "of him, by Jove! mouth—nose—eyes—hair turned off your brow just like his—a\r\n",
      "little in the foreign style. John Bull doesn’t do much of that. But your father\r\n",

      "her friends when she was a young lass—a proud-spirited lass, and pretty, by\r\n",
      "Jove! I knew the reason why she ran away,” said Raffles, winking slowly as he\r\n",
      "looked sideways at Will.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know nothing dishonorable of her, sir,” said Will, turning on him rather\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit!” said he, tossing his head decisively. “She was a little too\r\n",
      "honorable to like her friends—that was it!” Here Raffles again winked slowly.\r\n",
      "“Lord bless you, I knew all about ’em—a little in what you may call the\r\n",
      "respectable thieving line—the high style of receiving-house—none of your holes\r\n",
      "and corners—first-rate. Slap-up shop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord!\r\n",
      "Sarah would have known nothing about it—a dashing young lady she was—fine\r\n",
      "boarding-school—fit for a lord’s wife—only Archie Duncan threw it at her out of\r\n",
      "spite, because she would have nothing to do with him. And so she ran away from\r\n",
      "the whole concern. I travelled for ’em, sir, in a gentlemanly way—at a high\r\n",
      "salary. They didn’t mind her running away at first—godly folks, sir, very\r\n",
      "godly—and she was for the stage. The son was alive then, and the daughter was\r\n",
      "at a discount. Hallo! here we are at the Blue Bull. What do you say, Mr.\r\n",

      "welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come near her. However, let them\r\n",

      "early bent towards religion, his inclination to be a preacher, and his\r\n",
      "association with missionary and philanthropic efforts. She believed in him as\r\n",
      "an excellent man whose piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a\r\n",
      "layman, whose influence had turned her own mind toward seriousness, and whose\r\n",
      "share of perishable good had been the means of raising her own position. But\r\n",

      "and while true religion was everywhere saving, honest Mrs. Bulstrode was\r\n",
      "convinced that to be saved in the Church was more respectable. She so much\r\n",
      "wished to ignore towards others that her husband had ever been a London\r\n",
      "Dissenter, that she liked to keep it out of sight even in talking to him. He\r\n",

      "ingenuous wife, whose imitative piety and native worldliness were equally\r\n",
      "sincere, who had nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he had married out of a\r\n",
      "thorough inclination still subsisting. But his fears were such as belong to a\r\n",
      "man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy: the loss of high\r\n",
      "consideration from his wife, as from every one else who did not clearly hate\r\n",
      "him out of enmity to the truth, would be as the beginning of death to him. When\r\n",

      "But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust. In the\r\n",
      "interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his eagerness to\r\n",
      "torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed. He had frankly said\r\n",
      "that he had turned out of the way to come to Middlemarch, just to look about\r\n",
      "him and see whether the neighborhood would suit him to live in. He had\r\n",
      "certainly had a few debts to pay more than he expected, but the two hundred\r\n",
      "pounds were not gone yet: a cool five-and-twenty would suffice him to go away\r\n",
      "with for the present. What he had wanted chiefly was to see his friend Nick and\r\n",
      "family, and know all about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much\r\n",
      "attached. By-and-by he might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles\r\n",
      "declined to be “seen off the premises,” as he expressed it—declined to quit\r\n",

      "danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his neighbors and the\r\n",
      "mournful perception of his wife certain facts of his past life which would\r\n",
      "render him an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the religion with which he\r\n",
      "had diligently associated himself. The terror of being judged sharpens the\r\n",
      "memory: it sends an inevitable glare over that long-unvisited past which has\r\n",
      "been habitually recalled only in general phrases. Even without memory, the life\r\n",
      "is bound into one by a zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense\r\n",
      "memory forces a man to own his blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like\r\n",
      "a reopened wound, a man’s past is not simply a dead history, an outworn\r\n",
      "preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose from the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Into this second life Bulstrode’s past had now risen, only the pleasures of it\r\n",
      "seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day, without interruption save of\r\n",
      "brief sleep which only wove retrospect and fear into a fantastic present, he\r\n",
      "felt the scenes of his earlier life coming between him and everything else, as\r\n",
      "obstinately as when we look through the window from a lighted room, the objects\r\n",
      "we turn our backs on are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees.\r\n",

      "definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic dissenting church\r\n",
      "at Highbury, having had striking experience in conviction of sin and sense of\r\n",
      "pardon. Again he heard himself called for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer\r\n",
      "meetings, speaking on religious platforms, preaching in private houses. Again\r\n",
      "he felt himself thinking of the ministry as possibly his vocation, and inclined\r\n",
      "towards missionary labor. That was the happiest time of his life: that was the\r\n",
      "spot he would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream. The people\r\n",
      "among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very few, but they were\r\n",
      "very near to him, and stirred his satisfaction the more; his power stretched\r\n",
      "through a narrow space, but he felt its effect the more intensely. He believed\r\n",

      "he became an intimate there, honored for his piety by the wife, marked out for\r\n",
      "his ability by the husband, whose wealth was due to a flourishing city and\r\n",

      "most magnificent sort both in extent and profits; and on a short acquaintance\r\n",
      "with it Bulstrode became aware that one source of magnificent profit was the\r\n",
      "easy reception of any goods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He remembered his first moments of shrinking. They were private, and were\r\n",
      "filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer. The business\r\n",
      "was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to set up a new\r\n",
      "gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old one? The profits made\r\n",
      "out of lost souls—where can the line be drawn at which they begin in human\r\n",
      "transactions? Was it not even God’s way of saving His chosen? “Thou\r\n",

      "now—“Thou knowest how loose my soul sits from these things—how I view them all\r\n",

      "Bulstrode’s shrinking remained private. Mr. Dunkirk had never expected that\r\n",
      "there would be any shrinking at all: he had never conceived that trade had\r\n",
      "anything to do with the scheme of salvation. And it was true that Bulstrode\r\n",

      "masses of spider-web, padding the moral sensibility; nay, as age made egoism\r\n",
      "more eager but less enjoying, his soul had become more saturated with the\r\n",
      "belief that he did everything for God’s sake, being indifferent to it for his\r\n",

      "trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only daughter had run\r\n",
      "away, defied her parents, and gone on the stage; and now the only boy died, and\r\n",
      "after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also. The wife, a simple pious woman, left\r\n",
      "with all the wealth in and out of the magnificent trade, of which she never\r\n",
      "knew the precise nature, had come to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore\r\n",
      "him as women often adore their priest or “man-made” minister. It was natural\r\n",
      "that after a time marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.\r\n",
      "Dunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her daughter, who had long been regarded\r\n",
      "as lost both to God and her parents. It was known that the daughter had\r\n",
      "married, but she was utterly gone out of sight. The mother, having lost her\r\n",

      "If she were found, there would be a channel for property—perhaps a wide one—in\r\n",

      "before Mrs. Dunkirk would marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after\r\n",
      "advertisement as well as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the mother\r\n",
      "believed that her daughter was not to be found, and consented to marry without\r\n",

      "little sequences, each justified as it came by reasonings which seemed to prove\r\n",

      "the agent in making the best use of a large property and withdrawing it from\r\n",
      "perversion. Death and other striking dispositions, such as feminine\r\n",
      "trustfulness, had come; and Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell’s words—“Do\r\n",
      "you call these bare events? The Lord pity you!” The events were comparatively\r\n",
      "small, but the essential condition was there—namely, that they were in favor of\r\n",
      "his own ends. It was easy for him to settle what was due from him to others by\r\n",
      "inquiring what were God’s intentions with regard to himself. Could it be for\r\n",
      "God’s service that this fortune should in any considerable proportion go to a\r\n",
      "young woman and her husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits, and\r\n",
      "might scatter it abroad in triviality—people who seemed to lie outside the path\r\n",
      "of remarkable providences? Bulstrode had never said to himself beforehand, “The\r\n",
      "daughter shall not be found”—nevertheless when the moment came he kept her\r\n",
      "existence hidden; and when other moments followed, he soothed the mother with\r\n",

      "on redemption, and went on in his course of instrumentality. And after five\r\n",
      "years Death again came to widen his path, by taking away his wife. He did\r\n",
      "gradually withdraw his capital, but he did not make the sacrifices requisite to\r\n",
      "put an end to the business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards\r\n",
      "before it finally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his hundred\r\n",

      "had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs, and who had gradually explained\r\n",
      "the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with those\r\n",
      "beliefs. If this be hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally\r\n",

      "put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win protection. At last he\r\n",
      "came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter to Will Ladislaw, begging him\r\n",
      "to be at the Shrubs that evening for a private interview at nine o’clock. Will\r\n",

      "room, he was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker’s face, and was\r\n",
      "going to say, “Are you ill?” when, checking himself in that abruptness, he only\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, she is quite satisfied; she has gone out with her daughters this\r\n",

      "a very private—indeed, I will say, of a sacredly confidential nature, which I\r\n",
      "desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare say, has been farther from your thoughts\r\n",

      "Will felt something like an electric shock. He was already in a state of keen\r\n",
      "sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of ties in the past,\r\n",
      "and his presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed like the fluctuations of a\r\n",
      "dream—as if the action begun by that loud bloated stranger were being carried\r\n",
      "on by this pale-eyed sickly looking piece of respectability, whose subdued tone\r\n",
      "and glib formality of speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him as\r\n",

      "seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion to make the disclosure\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am told that your mother’s name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she ran away\r\n",
      "from her friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was at one time\r\n",
      "much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these statements?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, they are all true,” said Will, struck with the order in which an inquiry\r\n",
      "had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to the banker’s\r\n",
      "previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed the order of his\r\n",
      "emotions; he entertained no doubt that the opportunity for restitution had\r\n",
      "come, and he had an overpowering impulse towards the penitential expression by\r\n",
      "which he was deprecating chastisement.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know any particulars of your mother’s family?” he continued.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; she never liked to speak of them. She was a very generous, honorable\r\n",
      "woman,” said Will, almost angrily.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not wish to allege anything against her. Did she never mention her mother\r\n",
      "to you at all?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard her say that she thought her mother did not know the reason of\r\n",
      "her running away. She said ‘poor mother’ in a pitying tone.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That mother became my wife,” said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment before\r\n",
      "he added, “you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said before, not a legal\r\n",
      "claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I was enriched by that\r\n",
      "marriage—a result which would probably not have taken place—certainly not to\r\n",
      "the same extent—if your grandmother could have discovered her daughter. That\r\n",
      "daughter, I gather, is no longer living!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly within\r\n",
      "him, that without quite knowing what he did, he took his hat from the floor and\r\n",
      "stood up. The impulse within him was to reject the disclosed connection.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,” said Bulstrode, anxiously. “Doubtless you are\r\n",
      "startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat your patience with\r\n",
      "one who is already bowed down by inward trial.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt for this\r\n",
      "voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which befell\r\n",
      "your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to supply you\r\n",
      "adequately from a store which would have probably already been yours had your\r\n",
      "grandmother been certain of your mother’s existence and been able to find her.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode paused. He felt that he was performing a striking piece of\r\n",
      "scrupulosity in the judgment of his auditor, and a penitential act in the eyes\r\n",
      "of God. He had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw’s mind, smarting as it was\r\n",
      "from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its natural quickness in construction\r\n",
      "stimulated by the expectation of discoveries which he would have been glad to\r\n",
      "conjure back into darkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode, who at the end of his speech had cast his eyes on the floor, now\r\n",
      "raised them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose you did know of my mother’s existence, and knew where she might have\r\n",
      "been found.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode shrank—there was a visible quivering in his face and hands. He was\r\n",
      "totally unprepared to have his advances met in this way, or to find himself\r\n",
      "urged into more revelation than he had beforehand set down as needful. But at\r\n",
      "that moment he dared not tell a lie, and he felt suddenly uncertain of his\r\n",
      "ground which he had trodden with some confidence before.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,” he answered, with a faltering in\r\n",
      "his tone. “And I wish to make atonement to you as the one still remaining who\r\n",
      "has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I trust, into my purpose, Mr.\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher than merely human claims, and as I\r\n",
      "have already said, is entirely independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready\r\n",
      "to narrow my own resources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to\r\n",
      "allow you five hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a\r\n",
      "proportional capital at my death—nay, to do still more, if more should be\r\n",
      "definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.” Mr. Bulstrode had\r\n",
      "gone on to particulars in the expectation that these would work strongly on\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful acceptance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his lip pouting and his\r\n",
      "fingers in his side-pockets. He was not in the least touched, and said firmly,—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg you to\r\n",
      "answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business by which that\r\n",
      "fortune you speak of was originally made?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode’s thought was, “Raffles has told him.” How could he refuse to\r\n",
      "answer when he had volunteered what drew forth the question? He answered,\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And was that business—or was it not—a thoroughly dishonorable one—nay, one\r\n",
      "that, if its nature had been made public, might have ranked those concerned in\r\n",
      "it with thieves and convicts?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will’s tone had a cutting bitterness: he was moved to put his question as\r\n",
      "nakedly as he could.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He had been prepared for a scene\r\n",
      "of self-abasement, but his intense pride and his habit of supremacy overpowered\r\n",
      "penitence, and even dread, when this young man, whom he had meant to benefit,\r\n",
      "turned on him with the air of a judge.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The business was established before I became connected with it, sir; nor is it\r\n",
      "for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,” he answered, not raising his\r\n",
      "voice, but speaking with quick defiantness.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it is,” said Will, starting up again with his hat in his hand. “It is\r\n",
      "eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide whether I will have\r\n",
      "transactions with you and accept your money. My unblemished honor is important\r\n",
      "to me. It is important to me to have no stain on my birth and connections. And\r\n",
      "now I find there is a stain which I can’t help. My mother felt it, and tried to\r\n",
      "keep as clear of it as she could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten\r\n",
      "money. If I had any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who\r\n",
      "could disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is that you\r\n",
      "kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to lie with a man’s\r\n",
      "self that he is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was out of\r\n",
      "the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed behind him. He\r\n",
      "was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion against this inherited\r\n",
      "blot which had been thrust on his knowledge to reflect at present whether he\r\n",
      "had not been too hard on Bulstrode—too arrogantly merciless towards a man of\r\n",
      "sixty, who was making efforts at retrieval when time had rendered them vain.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the impetuosity of\r\n",
      "Will’s repulse or the bitterness of his words. No one but himself then knew how\r\n",
      "everything connected with the sentiment of his own dignity had an immediate\r\n",
      "bearing for him on his relation to Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon’s treatment of\r\n",
      "him. And in the rush of impulses by which he flung back that offer of\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s there was mingled the sense that it would have been impossible for\r\n",
      "him ever to tell Dorothea that he had accepted it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Bulstrode—when Will was gone he suffered a violent reaction, and wept\r\n",
      "like a woman. It was the first time he had encountered an open expression of\r\n",
      "scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that scorn hurrying like venom\r\n",
      "through his system, there was no sensibility left to consolations. But the\r\n",
      "relief of weeping had to be checked. His wife and daughters soon came home from\r\n",
      "hearing the address of an Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that\r\n",
      "papa had not heard, in the first instance, the interesting things which they\r\n",
      "tried to repeat to him.\r\n",

      "took it for granted that according to Mr. Casaubon’s arrangement marriage to\r\n",

      "is a pity that young Lydgate should have married one of these Middlemarch\r\n",
      "girls. Considering he’s a son of somebody, he might have got a woman with good\r\n",
      "blood in her veins, and not too young, who would have put up with his\r\n",
      "profession. There’s Clara Harfager, for instance, whose friends don’t know what\r\n",

      "hateful, and there was no place for her trustfulness. “It is not true—it is not\r\n",
      "true!” was the voice within her that she listened to; but all the while a\r\n",
      "remembrance to which there had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust\r\n",
      "itself on her attention—the remembrance of that day when she had found Will\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He said he would never do anything that I disapproved—I wish I could have told\r\n",

      "“They all try to blacken him before me; but I will care for no pain, if he is\r\n",
      "not to blame. I always believed he was good.”—These were her last thoughts\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea’s heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she was not\r\n",
      "perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there was for the moment\r\n",
      "all-satisfying to her, like the sight of something precious that one has lost.\r\n",
      "When she reached the door she said to Mrs. Kell—\r\n",

      "\n",

      "the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by looking at the\r\n",
      "memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature too mysterious for\r\n",
      "Dorothea. He was smiling at it still, and shaking the sketches into order with\r\n",
      "the thought that he might find a letter from her awaiting him at Middlemarch,\r\n",
      "when Mrs. Kell close to his elbow said—\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Kell closed the door behind her they met: each was looking at the other, and\r\n",
      "consciousness was overflowed by something that suppressed utterance. It was not\r\n",
      "confusion that kept them silent, for they both felt that parting was near, and\r\n",
      "there is no shamefacedness in a sad parting.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She moved automatically towards her uncle’s chair against the writing-table,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Pray sit down,” said Dorothea, crossing her hands on her lap; “I am very glad\r\n",

      "shook hands with him in Rome; for her widow’s cap, fixed in her bonnet, had\r\n",
      "gone off with it, and he could see that she had lately been shedding tears. But\r\n",
      "the mixture of anger in her agitation had vanished at the sight of him; she had\r\n",
      "been used, when they were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy\r\n",
      "freedom which comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people’s\r\n",
      "words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take possession\r\n",
      "of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once more—what does it\r\n",
      "signify that we heard it found fault with in its absence?\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,” said\r\n",

      "“I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago—you thought you\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now—things which have\r\n",
      "altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you before, I was dreaming\r\n",
      "that I might come back some day. I don’t think I ever shall—now.” Will paused\r\n",
      "here.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You wished me to know the reasons?” said Dorothea, timidly.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Will, impetuously, shaking his head backward, and looking away from\r\n",
      "her with irritation in his face. “Of course I must wish it. I have been grossly\r\n",
      "insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others. There has been a mean\r\n",
      "implication against my character. I wish you to know that under no\r\n",
      "circumstances would I have lowered myself by—under no circumstances would I\r\n",
      "have given men the chance of saying that I sought money under the pretext of\r\n",
      "seeking—something else. There was no need of other safeguard against me—the\r\n",
      "safeguard of wealth was enough.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will rose from his chair with the last word and went—he hardly knew where; but\r\n",
      "it was to the projecting window nearest him, which had been open as now about\r\n",
      "the same season a year ago, when he and Dorothea had stood within it and talked\r\n",
      "together. Her whole heart was going out at this moment in sympathy with Will’s\r\n",
      "indignation: she only wanted to convince him that she had never done him\r\n",
      "injustice, and he seemed to have turned away from her as if she too had been\r\n",
      "part of the unfriendly world.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any meanness\r\n",
      "to you,” she began. Then in her ardent way, wanting to plead with him, she\r\n",
      "moved from her chair and went in front of him to her old place in the window,\r\n",
      "saying, “Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in you?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Will saw her there, he gave a start and moved backward out of the window,\r\n",
      "without meeting her glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement following up the\r\n",
      "previous anger of his tone. She was ready to say that it was as hard on her as\r\n",
      "on him, and that she was helpless; but those strange particulars of their\r\n",
      "relation which neither of them could explicitly mention kept her always in\r\n",
      "dread of saying too much. At this moment she had no belief that Will would in\r\n",
      "any case have wanted to marry her, and she feared using words which might imply\r\n",
      "such a belief. She only said earnestly, recurring to his last word—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his feelings these words of\r\n",
      "hers seemed to him cruelly neutral, and he looked pale and miserable after his\r\n",
      "angry outburst. He went to the table and fastened up his portfolio, while\r\n",
      "Dorothea looked at him from the distance. They were wasting these last moments\r\n",
      "together in wretched silence. What could he say, since what had got obstinately\r\n",
      "uppermost in his mind was the passionate love for her which he forbade himself\r\n",
      "to utter? What could she say, since she might offer him no help—since she was\r\n",
      "forced to keep the money that ought to have been his?—since to-day he seemed\r\n",
      "not to respond as he used to do to her thorough trust and liking?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Will at last turned away from his portfolio and approached the window\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go,” he said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which sometimes\r\n",
      "accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and burned with gazing\r\n",
      "too close at a light.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What shall you do in life?” said Dorothea, timidly. “Have your intentions\r\n",
      "remained just the same as when we said good-by before?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as uninteresting.\r\n",
      "“I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I suppose one gets a habit\r\n",
      "of doing without happiness or hope.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, what sad words!” said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob. Then\r\n",
      "trying to smile, she added, “We used to agree that we were alike in speaking\r\n",
      "too strongly.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not spoken too strongly now,” said Will, leaning back against the angle\r\n",
      "of the wall. “There are certain things which a man can only go through once in\r\n",
      "his life; and he must know some time or other that the best is over with him.\r\n",
      "This experience has happened to me while I am very young—that is all. What I\r\n",
      "care more for than I can ever care for anything else is absolutely forbidden to\r\n",
      "me—I don’t mean merely by being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it\r\n",
      "were within my reach, by my own pride and honor—by everything I respect myself\r\n",
      "for. Of course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in a\r\n",
      "trance.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to\r\n",
      "misunderstand this; indeed he felt that he was contradicting himself and\r\n",
      "offending against his self-approval in speaking to her so plainly; but still—it\r\n",
      "could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her that he would never woo\r\n",

      "longer there. She sank into the chair, and for a few moments sat like a statue,\r\n",
      "while images and emotions were hurrying upon her. Joy came first, in spite of\r\n",

      "The joy was not the less—perhaps it was the more complete just then—because of\r\n",
      "the irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder to\r\n",

      "was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid the dust, and the blue sky looked\r\n",
      "far off, away from the region of the great clouds that sailed in masses. The\r\n",

      "along as a poor devil seeking a position in a world which in his present temper\r\n",
      "offered him little that he coveted, made his conduct seem a mere matter of\r\n",

      "dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or foolish, he could hardly allow\r\n",

      "in her fullest matronly bloom, looked at Mary’s little figure, rough wavy hair,\r\n",
      "and visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying unsuccessfully\r\n",
      "to fancy herself caring about Mary’s appearance in wedding clothes, or feeling\r\n",
      "complacency in grandchildren who would “feature” the Garths. However, the party\r\n",
      "was a merry one, and Mary was particularly bright; being glad, for Fred’s sake,\r\n",
      "that his friends were getting kinder to her, and being also quite willing that\r\n",

      "and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had not been roused to bestow\r\n",
      "on her would have perceived the total absence of that interest in her husband’s\r\n",
      "presence which a loving wife is sure to betray, even if etiquette keeps her\r\n",
      "aloof from him. When Lydgate was taking part in the conversation, she never\r\n",
      "looked towards him any more than if she had been a sculptured Psyche modelled\r\n",
      "to look another way: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he\r\n",
      "re-entered the room, she seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months\r\n",
      "before would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In reality,\r\n",
      "however, she was intensely aware of Lydgate’s voice and movements; and her\r\n",
      "pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a studied negation by which she\r\n",

      "house. I am of a cheerful disposition myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes\r\n",
      "something to be going on. That is what Rosamond has been used to. Very\r\n",
      "different from a husband out at odd hours, and never knowing when he will come\r\n",
      "home, and of a close, proud disposition, I think”—indiscreet Mrs. Vincy\r\n",

      "angel of a temper; her brothers used very often not to please her, but she was\r\n",
      "never the girl to show temper; from a baby she was always as good as good, and\r\n",

      "to eleven. But in that smiling glance she was obliged to include Mary Garth,\r\n",
      "whom the three girls had got into a corner to make her tell them stories. Mary\r\n",
      "was just finishing the delicious tale of Rumpelstiltskin, which she had well by\r\n",

      "from a favorite red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy’s darling, now ran to her with\r\n",
      "wide-eyed serious excitement, crying, “Oh mamma, mamma, the little man stamped\r\n",

      "again. He insisted too, and Mary, without fuss, began again in her neat\r\n",
      "fashion, with precisely the same words as before. Fred, who had also seated\r\n",
      "himself near, would have felt unmixed triumph in Mary’s effectiveness if Mr.\r\n",

      "from annoyances, but from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances,\r\n",

      "sense that there was a grand existence in thought and effective action lying\r\n",
      "around him, while his self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of\r\n",
      "egoistic fears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears.\r\n",
      "His troubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the attention of\r\n",

      "a smaller house: Trumbull, I know, has a very decent one to let at thirty\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was something like fierceness in Lydgate’s eyes, as he answered with new\r\n",
      "violence, “Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it. I admit that I\r\n",
      "like it better than making a fool of myself by going to beg where it’s of no\r\n",
      "use. Understand then, that it is what I like to do.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the clutch of his\r\n",
      "strong hand on Rosamond’s delicate arm. But for all that, his will was not a\r\n",
      "whit stronger than hers. She immediately walked out of the room in silence, but\r\n",
      "with an intense determination to hinder what Lydgate liked to do.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out of the house, but as his blood cooled he felt that the chief result\r\n",
      "of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him at the idea of opening with\r\n",
      "his wife in future subjects which might again urge him to violent speech. It\r\n",
      "was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had begun, and he was afraid of any\r\n",
      "movement that might make it fatal. His marriage would be a mere piece of bitter\r\n",
      "irony if they could not go on loving each other. He had long ago made up his\r\n",
      "mind to what he thought was her negative character—her want of sensibility,\r\n",
      "which showed itself in disregard both of his specific wishes and of his general\r\n",
      "aims. The first great disappointment had been borne: the tender devotedness and\r\n",
      "docile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced, and life must be taken up\r\n",
      "on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost their limbs. But\r\n",
      "the real wife had not only her claims, she had still a hold on his heart, and\r\n",
      "it was his intense desire that the hold should remain strong. In marriage, the\r\n",
      "certainty, “She will never love me much,” is easier to bear than the fear, “I\r\n",
      "shall love her no more.” Hence, after that outburst, his inward effort was\r\n",
      "entirely to excuse her, and to blame the hard circumstances which were partly\r\n",
      "his fault. He tried that evening, by petting her, to heal the wound he had made\r\n",
      "in the morning, and it was not in Rosamond’s nature to be repellent or sulky;\r\n",
      "indeed, she welcomed the signs that her husband loved her and was under\r\n",
      "control. But this was something quite distinct from loving him. Lydgate\r\n",
      "would not have chosen soon to recur to the plan of parting with the house; he\r\n",
      "was resolved to carry it out, and say as little more about it as possible. But\r\n",
      "Rosamond herself touched on it at breakfast by saying, mildly—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Lydgate, “but I shall call on him as I go by this morning. No time\r\n",
      "must be lost.” He took Rosamond’s question as a sign that she withdrew her\r\n",
      "inward opposition, and kissed her head caressingly when he got up to go away.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs. Plymdale,\r\n",
      "Mr. Ned’s mother, and entered with pretty congratulations into the subject of\r\n",
      "the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale’s maternal view was, that Rosamond might\r\n",
      "possibly now have retrospective glimpses of her own folly; and feeling the\r\n",
      "advantages to be at present all on the side of her son, was too kind a woman\r\n",
      "not to behave graciously.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could desire in\r\n",
      "a daughter-in-law. Of course her father is able to do something handsome for\r\n",
      "her—that is only what would be expected with a brewery like his. And the\r\n",
      "connection is everything we should desire. But that is not what I look at. She\r\n",
      "is such a very nice girl—no airs, no pretensions, though on a level with the\r\n",
      "first. I don’t mean with the titled aristocracy. I see very little good in\r\n",
      "people aiming out of their own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best\r\n",
      "in the town, and she is contented with that.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have always thought her very agreeable,” said Rosamond.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his head too high, that he\r\n",
      "should have got into the very best connection,” continued Mrs. Plymdale, her\r\n",
      "native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she was taking a correct view.\r\n",
      "“And such particular people as the Tollers are, they might have objected\r\n",
      "because some of our friends are not theirs. It is well known that your aunt\r\n",
      "Bulstrode and I have been intimate from our youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been\r\n",
      "always on Mr. Bulstrode’s side. And I myself prefer serious opinions. But the\r\n",
      "Tollers have welcomed Ned all the same.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure he is a very deserving, well-principled young man,” said Rosamond,\r\n",
      "with a neat air of patronage in return for Mrs. Plymdale’s wholesome\r\n",
      "corrections.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of carriage as\r\n",
      "if everybody was beneath him, or that showy kind of talking, and singing, and\r\n",
      "intellectual talent. But I am thankful he has not. It is a poor preparation\r\n",
      "both for here and Hereafter.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,” said\r\n",
      "Rosamond. “I think there is every prospect of their being a happy couple. What\r\n",
      "house will they take?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, as for that, they must put up with what they can get. They have been\r\n",
      "looking at the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s; it belongs\r\n",
      "to him, and he is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose they are not likely to\r\n",
      "hear of a better. Indeed, I think Ned will decide the matter to-day.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter’s Place.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows are\r\n",
      "narrow, and it is all ups and downs. You don’t happen to know of any other that\r\n",
      "would be at liberty?” said Mrs. Plymdale, fixing her round black eyes on\r\n",
      "Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in them.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no; I hear so little of those things.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to pay her\r\n",
      "visit; she had simply meant to gather any information which would help her to\r\n",
      "avert the parting with her own house under circumstances thoroughly\r\n",
      "disagreeable to her. As to the untruth in her reply, she no more reflected on\r\n",
      "it than she did on the untruth there was in her saying that appearances had\r\n",
      "very little to do with happiness. Her object, she was convinced, was thoroughly\r\n",
      "justifiable: it was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a\r\n",
      "plan in her mind which, when she had carried it out fully, would prove how very\r\n",
      "false a step it would have been for him to have descended from his position.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull’s office, meaning to call there. It\r\n",
      "was the first time in her life that Rosamond had thought of doing anything in\r\n",
      "the form of business, but she felt equal to the occasion. That she should be\r\n",
      "obliged to do what she intensely disliked, was an idea which turned her quiet\r\n",
      "tenacity into active invention. Here was a case in which it could not be enough\r\n",
      "simply to disobey and be serenely, placidly obstinate: she must act according\r\n",
      "to her judgment, and she said to herself that her judgment was right—“indeed,\r\n",
      "if it had not been, she would not have wished to act on it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Trumbull was in the back-room of his office, and received Rosamond with his\r\n",
      "finest manners, not only because he had much sensibility to her charms, but\r\n",
      "because the good-natured fibre in him was stirred by his certainty that Lydgate\r\n",
      "was in difficulties, and that this uncommonly pretty woman—this young lady with\r\n",
      "the highest personal attractions—was likely to feel the pinch of trouble—to\r\n",
      "find herself involved in circumstances beyond her control. He begged her to do\r\n",
      "him the honor to take a seat, and stood before her trimming and comporting\r\n",
      "himself with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent. Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "first question was, whether her husband had called on Mr. Trumbull that\r\n",
      "morning, to speak about disposing of their house.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, yes, he did; he did so,” said the good auctioneer, trying to throw\r\n",
      "something soothing into his iteration. “I was about to fulfil his order, if\r\n",
      "possible, this afternoon. He wished me not to procrastinate.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of you not\r\n",
      "to mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige me?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly I will, Mrs. Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with me on\r\n",
      "business or any other topic. I am then to consider the commission withdrawn?”\r\n",
      "said Mr. Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of his blue cravat with both hands,\r\n",
      "and looking at Rosamond deferentially.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, if you please. I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house—the one in\r\n",
      "St. Peter’s Place next to Mr. Hackbutt’s. Mr. Lydgate would be annoyed that his\r\n",
      "orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides that, there are other\r\n",
      "circumstances which render the proposal unnecessary.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever you\r\n",
      "require any service of me,” said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in\r\n",
      "conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. “Rely on me, I beg. The\r\n",
      "affair shall go no further.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond was more\r\n",
      "lively than she had usually been of late, and even seemed interested in doing\r\n",
      "what would please him without being asked. He thought, “If she will be happy\r\n",
      "and I can rub through, what does it all signify? It is only a narrow swamp that\r\n",
      "we have to pass in a long journey. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall\r\n",
      "do.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so much cheered that he began to search for an account of experiments\r\n",
      "which he had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected out of that creeping\r\n",
      "self-despair which comes in the train of petty anxieties. He felt again some of\r\n",
      "the old delightful absorption in a far-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played\r\n",
      "the quiet music which was as helpful to his meditation as the plash of an oar\r\n",
      "on the evening lake. It was rather late; he had pushed away all the books, and\r\n",
      "was looking at the fire with his hands clasped behind his head in forgetfulness\r\n",
      "of everything except the construction of a new controlling experiment, when\r\n",
      "Rosamond, who had left the piano and was leaning back in her chair watching\r\n",
      "him, said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a man who\r\n",
      "has been disturbed in his sleep. Then flushing with an unpleasant\r\n",
      "consciousness, he asked—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you know?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I called at Mrs. Plymdale’s this morning, and she told me that he had taken\r\n",
      "the house in St. Peter’s Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt’s.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was silent. He drew his hands from behind his head and pressed them\r\n",
      "against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass on his\r\n",
      "forehead, while he rested his elbows on his knees. He was feeling bitter\r\n",
      "disappointment, as if he had opened a door out of a suffocating place and had\r\n",
      "found it walled up; but he also felt sure that Rosamond was pleased with the\r\n",
      "cause of his disappointment. He preferred not looking at her and not speaking,\r\n",
      "until he had got over the first spasm of vexation. After all, he said in his\r\n",
      "bitterness, what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a\r\n",
      "husband without them is an absurdity. When he looked up and pushed his hair\r\n",
      "aside, his dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy in them,\r\n",
      "but he only said, coolly—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the look-out if he\r\n",
      "failed with Plymdale.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond made no remark. She trusted to the chance that nothing more would pass\r\n",
      "between her husband and the auctioneer until some issue should have justified\r\n",
      "her interference; at any rate, she had hindered the event which she immediately\r\n",
      "dreaded. After a pause, she said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "“What disagreeable people?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Those who took the list—and the others. I mean, how much money would satisfy\r\n",
      "them so that you need not be troubled any more?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate surveyed her for a moment, as if he were looking for symptoms, and then\r\n",
      "said, “Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for furniture and as\r\n",
      "premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off Dover, and given enough on\r\n",
      "account to the others to make them wait patiently, if we contracted our\r\n",
      "expenses.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“More than I am likely to get anywhere,” said Lydgate, with rather a grating\r\n",
      "sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to perceive that Rosamond’s mind was\r\n",
      "wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible efforts.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should you not mention the sum?” said Rosamond, with a mild indication\r\n",
      "that she did not like his manners.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Lydgate in a guessing tone, “it would take at least a thousand to\r\n",
      "set me at ease. But,” he added, incisively, “I have to consider what I shall do\r\n",
      "without it, not with it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond said no more.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the next day she carried out her plan of writing to Sir Godwin Lydgate.\r\n",
      "Since the Captain’s visit, she had received a letter from him, and also one\r\n",
      "from Mrs. Mengan, his married sister, condoling with her on the loss of her\r\n",
      "baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they should see her again at\r\n",
      "Quallingham. Lydgate had told her that this politeness meant nothing; but she\r\n",
      "was secretly convinced that any backwardness in Lydgate’s family towards him\r\n",
      "was due to his cold and contemptuous behavior, and she had answered the letters\r\n",
      "in her most charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation\r\n",
      "would follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently was not a\r\n",
      "great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might have been abroad.\r\n",
      "However, the season was come for thinking of friends at home, and at any rate\r\n",
      "Sir Godwin, who had chucked her under the chin, and pronounced her to be like\r\n",
      "the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly, who had made a conquest of him in 1790,\r\n",
      "would be touched by any appeal from her, and would find it pleasant for her\r\n",
      "sake to behave as he ought to do towards his nephew. Rosamond was naively\r\n",
      "convinced of what an old gentleman ought to do to prevent her from suffering\r\n",
      "annoyance. And she wrote what she considered the most judicious letter\r\n",
      "possible—one which would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her excellent\r\n",
      "sense—pointing out how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place\r\n",
      "as Middlemarch for one more fitted to his talents, how the unpleasant character\r\n",
      "of the inhabitants had hindered his professional success, and how in\r\n",
      "consequence he was in money difficulties, from which it would require a\r\n",
      "thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him. She did not say that Tertius was\r\n",
      "unaware of her intention to write; for she had the idea that his supposed\r\n",
      "sanction of her letter would be in accordance with what she did say of his\r\n",
      "great regard for his uncle Godwin as the relative who had always been his best\r\n",
      "friend. Such was the force of Poor Rosamond’s tactics now she applied them to\r\n",
      "affairs.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This had happened before the party on New Year’s Day, and no answer had yet\r\n",
      "come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had to learn that\r\n",
      "Rosamond had revoked his order to Borthrop Trumbull. Feeling it necessary that\r\n",
      "she should be gradually accustomed to the idea of their quitting the house in\r\n",
      "Lowick Gate, he overcame his reluctance to speak to her again on the subject,\r\n",
      "and when they were breakfasting said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him to advertise the house\r\n",
      "in the ‘Pioneer’ and the ‘Trumpet.’ If the thing were advertised, some one\r\n",
      "might be inclined to take it who would not otherwise have thought of a change.\r\n",
      "In these country places many people go on in their old houses when their\r\n",
      "families are too large for them, for want of knowing where they can find\r\n",
      "another. And Trumbull seems to have got no bite at all.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. “I ordered Trumbull not to\r\n",
      "inquire further,” she said, with a careful calmness which was evidently\r\n",
      "defensive.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate stared at her in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he had been\r\n",
      "fastening up her plaits for her, and talking the “little language” of\r\n",
      "affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it, accepted as if she had been\r\n",
      "a serene and lovely image, now and then miraculously dimpling towards her\r\n",
      "votary. With such fibres still astir in him, the shock he received could not at\r\n",
      "once be distinctly anger; it was confused pain. He laid down the knife and fork\r\n",
      "with which he was carving, and throwing himself back in his chair, said at\r\n",
      "last, with a cool irony in his tone—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I ask when and why you did so?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him not to\r\n",
      "mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him not to let the affair go\r\n",
      "on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious to you if it were known\r\n",
      "that you wished to part with your house and furniture, and I had a very strong\r\n",
      "objection to it. I think that was reason enough.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons of\r\n",
      "another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different conclusion, and\r\n",
      "given an order accordingly?” said Lydgate, bitingly, the thunder and lightning\r\n",
      "gathering about his brow and eyes.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of any one’s anger on Rosamond had always been to make her shrink in\r\n",
      "cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in the conviction that\r\n",

      "by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the defects of his handwriting,\r\n",
      "this practice being, perhaps, a little the less severe that it was often\r\n",

      "old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general, considered\r\n",
      "from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He had not been out\r\n",
      "hunting once this season, had had no horse of his own to ride, and had gone\r\n",
      "from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his gig, or on the sober cob\r\n",
      "which Mr. Garth could lend him. It was a little too bad, Fred began to think,\r\n",
      "that he should be kept in the traces with more severity than if he had been a\r\n",
      "clergyman. “I will tell you what, Mistress Mary—it will be rather harder work\r\n",
      "to learn surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,”\r\n",
      "he had said, wishing her to appreciate what he went through for her sake; “and\r\n",
      "as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They had sport, and never\r\n",

      "meaning to go fast or far. There could be no reason why he should not play at\r\n",

      "Garth offered him, and returning it, which he could easily do by giving up all\r\n",
      "futile money-spending, since he had a superfluous stock of clothes, and no\r\n",
      "expense in his board. In that way he could, in one year, go a good way towards\r\n",
      "repaying the ninety pounds of which he had deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a\r\n",
      "time when she needed that sum more than she did now. Nevertheless, it must be\r\n",

      "the billiard-room, Fred had, not in his pocket, but in his mind, the ten pounds\r\n",
      "which he meant to reserve for himself from his half-year’s salary (having\r\n",
      "before him the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely\r\n",
      "to be come home again)—he had those ten pounds in his mind as a fund from which\r\n",
      "he might risk something, if there were a chance of a good bet. Why? Well, when\r\n",
      "sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn’t he catch a few? He would never go\r\n",
      "far along that road again; but a man likes to assure himself, and men of\r\n",
      "pleasure generally, what he could do in the way of mischief if he chose, and\r\n",
      "that if he abstains from making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking\r\n",
      "with the utmost looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow,\r\n",
      "it is not because he is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,\r\n",
      "which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling returns\r\n",
      "of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was lurking in him a\r\n",
      "prophetic sense that evening, that when he began to play he should also begin\r\n",
      "to bet—that he should enjoy some punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself\r\n",
      "for feeling “rather seedy” in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements\r\n",
      "that action often begins.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "opinion that he was a prig, and tremendously conscious of his\r\n",
      "superiority—looking excited and betting, just as he himself might have done.\r\n",
      "Fred felt a shock greater than he could quite account for by the vague\r\n",
      "knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his father had refused to help\r\n",
      "him; and his own inclination to enter into the play was suddenly checked. It\r\n",
      "was a strange reversal of attitudes: Fred’s blond face and blue eyes, usually\r\n",
      "bright and careless, ready to give attention to anything that held out a\r\n",
      "promise of amusement, looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if\r\n",
      "by the sight of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air\r\n",
      "of self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to lie\r\n",
      "behind his most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking with that\r\n",
      "excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal with fierce eyes\r\n",
      "and retractile claws.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, by betting on his own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but young\r\n",
      "Hawley’s arrival had changed the poise of things. He made first-rate strokes\r\n",
      "himself, and began to bet against Lydgate’s strokes, the strain of whose nerves\r\n",
      "was thus changed from simple confidence in his own movements to defying another\r\n",
      "person’s doubt in them. The defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but\r\n",
      "it was less sure. He continued to bet on his own play, but began often to fail.\r\n",
      "Still he went on, for his mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous\r\n",
      "crevice of play as if he had been the most ignorant lounger there. Fred\r\n",
      "observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the new situation\r\n",
      "of puzzling his brains to think of some device by which, without being\r\n",
      "offensive, he could withdraw Lydgate’s attention, and perhaps suggest to him a\r\n",
      "reason for quitting the room. He saw that others were observing Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "strange unlikeness to himself, and it occurred to him that merely to touch his\r\n",
      "elbow and call him aside for a moment might rouse him from his absorption. He\r\n",
      "could think of nothing cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he\r\n",
      "wanted to see Rosy, and wished to know if she were at home this evening; and he\r\n",
      "was going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up to\r\n",
      "him with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and begged to speak\r\n",
      "with him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he would be\r\n",

      "might be a widening channel for worthy activity, to start again without any\r\n",

      "procurable at all, might not be quickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond\r\n",

      "sleep, which was really only a slight exaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic\r\n",
      "symptom, had been dwelt on by him as a sign of threatening insanity. He wanted\r\n",

      "nothing to tell beyond what he had told before. He listened eagerly to what\r\n",
      "Lydgate had to say in dissipation of his fears, though this too was only\r\n",
      "repetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a medical opinion\r\n",
      "with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the communication of a personal need to\r\n",
      "him easier than it had been in Lydgate’s contemplation beforehand. He had been\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate frame,”\r\n",

      "visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we may well besiege\r\n",
      "the Mercy-seat for our protection,” said Mr. Bulstrode, not intending to evade\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s allusion, but really preoccupied with alarms about himself.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have at all events taken your share in using good practical precautions\r\n",
      "for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for protection,” said\r\n",
      "Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the\r\n",
      "banker’s religion, somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy.\r\n",
      "But his mind had taken up its long-prepared movement towards getting help, and\r\n",
      "was not yet arrested. He added, “The town has done well in the way of\r\n",
      "cleansing, and finding appliances; and I think that if the cholera should come,\r\n",

      "Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have for some time been\r\n",
      "entertaining a purpose to that effect—a purpose of a very decided character. I\r\n",
      "contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal from the management of much\r\n",
      "business, whether benevolent or commercial. Also I think of changing my\r\n",
      "residence for a time: probably I shall close or let ‘The Shrubs,’ and take some\r\n",

      "measure which you would recommend?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "indicated, of course I must cease to have any personal share in the management,\r\n",
      "and it is contrary to my views of responsibility to continue a large\r\n",
      "application of means to an institution which I cannot watch over and to some\r\n",
      "extent regulate. I shall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave\r\n",
      "Middlemarch, consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than\r\n",
      "that which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of\r\n",
      "building it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful\r\n",
      "working.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his wont, was, “He has\r\n",
      "perhaps been losing a good deal of money.” This was the most plausible\r\n",
      "explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling change in his\r\n",
      "expectations. He said in reply—\r\n",

      "“The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hardly,” returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone; “except by\r\n",
      "some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly counted on as\r\n",
      "willing to increase her contributions is Mrs. Casaubon. I have had an interview\r\n",
      "with her on the subject, and I have pointed out to her, as I am about to do to\r\n",
      "you, that it will be desirable to win a more general support to the New\r\n",
      "Hospital by a change of system.” Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the New\r\n",
      "Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder institution,\r\n",
      "having the same directing board. It will be necessary, also, that the medical\r\n",
      "management of the two shall be combined. In this way any difficulty as to the\r\n",
      "adequate maintenance of our new establishment will be removed; the benevolent\r\n",
      "interests of the town will cease to be divided.”\r\n",
      "\n",

      "coat as he again paused.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,” said Lydgate, with an\r\n",
      "edge of irony in his tone. “But I can’t be expected to rejoice in it at once,\r\n",
      "since one of the first results will be that the other medical men will upset or\r\n",
      "interrupt my methods, if it were only because they are mine.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of new and\r\n",
      "independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the original plan, I\r\n",
      "confess, was one which I had much at heart, under submission to the Divine\r\n",
      "Will. But since providential indications demand a renunciation from me, I\r\n",
      "renounce.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "quite consistent with a mode of putting the facts which made it difficult for\r\n",
      "Lydgate to vent his own indignation and disappointment. After some rapid\r\n",
      "reflection, he only asked—\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and happily in possession—not I\r\n",
      "presume of great wealth, but of funds which she can well spare. She has\r\n",
      "informed me that though she has destined the chief part of those funds to\r\n",
      "another purpose, she is willing to consider whether she cannot fully take my\r\n",
      "place in relation to the Hospital. But she wishes for ample time to mature her\r\n",
      "thoughts on the subject, and I have told her that there is no need for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate was ready to say, “If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place, there would\r\n",

      "arrested this cheerful candor. He replied, “I suppose, then, that I may enter\r\n",
      "into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely; that is what she expressly desires. Her decision, she says, will\r\n",

      "just setting out on a journey. I have her letter here,” said Mr. Bulstrode,\r\n",
      "drawing it out, and reading from it. “‘I am immediately otherwise engaged,’ she\r\n",
      "says. ‘I am going into Yorkshire with Sir James and Lady Chettam; and the\r\n",
      "conclusions I come to about some land which I am to see there may affect my\r\n",
      "power of contributing to the Hospital.’ Thus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste\r\n",
      "necessary in this matter; but I wished to apprise you beforehand of what may\r\n",
      "possibly occur.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his side-pocket, and changed his attitude\r\n",
      "as if his business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope about the Hospital\r\n",
      "only made him more conscious of the facts which poisoned his hope, felt that\r\n",
      "his effort after help, if made at all, must be made now and vigorously.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,” he said, with a firm\r\n",

      "that he spoke unwillingly. “The highest object to me is my profession, and I\r\n",
      "had identified the Hospital with the best use I can at present make of my\r\n",
      "profession. But the best use is not always the same with monetary success.\r\n",
      "Everything which has made the Hospital unpopular has helped with other causes—I\r\n",

      "sympathy with his friend’s pleasure in entertaining a man who had been\r\n",
      "serviceable to him, and who had not had all his earnings. There was a cunning\r\n",

      "this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might otherwise injure himself;\r\n",
      "he implied, without the direct form of falsehood, that there was a family tie\r\n",
      "which bound him to this care, and that there were signs of mental alienation in\r\n",
      "Raffles which urged caution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away\r\n",
      "the next morning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode\r\n",
      "with precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and accounting\r\n",
      "for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even with food and drink.\r\n",
      "But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in his loud and\r\n",
      "plain references to past facts—lest Mrs. Bulstrode should be even tempted to\r\n",
      "listen at the door. How could he hinder her, how betray his terror by opening\r\n",
      "the door to detect her? She was a woman of honest direct habits, and little\r\n",

      "his motives for averting the worst evil if in anything he had used falsity and\r\n",

      "surprised that a strict man like their master, who held his head high in the\r\n",
      "world, should be ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him. The\r\n",
      "banker’s drive of ten miles with his hated companion was a dreary beginning of\r\n",
      "the Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles had recovered his\r\n",
      "spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there was the good reason that\r\n",
      "the banker had given him a hundred pounds. Various motives urged Bulstrode to\r\n",
      "this open-handedness, but he did not himself inquire closely into all of them.\r\n",
      "As he had stood watching Raffles in his uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered\r\n",

      "hundred pounds.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his resolve not to be\r\n",

      "had shown the risks of bribing him to be quite equal to the risks of defying\r\n",
      "him. But when, freed from his repulsive presence, Bulstrode returned to his\r\n",
      "quiet home, he brought with him no confidence that he had secured more than a\r\n",
      "respite. It was as if he had had a loathsome dream, and could not shake off its\r\n",
      "images with their hateful kindred of sensations—as if on all the pleasant\r\n",
      "surroundings of his life a dangerous reptile had left his slimy traces.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of uneasy\r\n",
      "presentiment in his wife’s mind, because she carefully avoided any allusion to\r\n",
      "it. He had been used every day to taste the flavor of supremacy and the tribute\r\n",
      "of complete deference: and the certainty that he was watched or measured with a\r\n",
      "hidden suspicion of his having some discreditable secret, made his voice totter\r\n",
      "when he was speaking to edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode’s anxious\r\n",
      "temperament, is often worse than seeing; and his imagination continually\r\n",
      "heightened the anguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his\r\n",
      "defiance of Raffles did not keep the man away—and though he prayed for this\r\n",
      "result he hardly hoped for it—the disgrace was certain. In vain he said to\r\n",
      "himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a chastisement, a\r\n",
      "preparation; he recoiled from the imagined burning; and he judged that it must\r\n",
      "be more for the Divine glory that he should escape dishonor. That recoil had at\r\n",
      "last urged him to make preparations for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth\r\n",
      "must be reported of him, he would then be at a less scorching distance from the\r\n",
      "contempt of his old neighbors; and in a new scene, where his life would not\r\n",
      "have gathered the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he pursued him,\r\n",
      "would be less formidable. To leave the place finally would, he knew, be\r\n",
      "extremely painful to his wife, and on other grounds he would have preferred to\r\n",
      "stay where he had struck root. Hence he made his preparations at first in a\r\n",
      "conditional way, wishing to leave on all sides an opening for his return after\r\n",
      "brief absence, if any favorable intervention of Providence should dissipate his\r\n",
      "fears. He was preparing to transfer his management of the Bank, and to give up\r\n",
      "any active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the\r\n",
      "ground of his failing health, but without excluding his future resumption of\r\n",
      "such work. The measure would cause him some added expense and some diminution\r\n",
      "of income beyond what he had already undergone from the general depression of\r\n",
      "trade; and the Hospital presented itself as a principal object of outlay on\r\n",
      "which he could fairly economize.\r\n",

      "which he could recall them if they proved to be unnecessary. He continually\r\n",
      "deferred the final steps; in the midst of his fears, like many a man who is in\r\n",
      "danger of shipwreck or of being dashed from his carriage by runaway horses, he\r\n",
      "had a clinging impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and\r\n",
      "that to spoil his life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty—especially\r\n",

      "on the stock, and to have an arrangement by which he himself could, if he\r\n",

      "always fearing an excess for him as he grew older. But on quitting Bulstrode\r\n",
      "after that conversation, a very alluring idea occurred to him about this said\r\n",
      "letting of Stone Court. What if Bulstrode would agree to his placing Fred Vincy\r\n",
      "there on the understanding that he, Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the\r\n",
      "management? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he might make a modest\r\n",
      "income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by helping in other\r\n",
      "business. He mentioned his notion to Mrs. Garth with such evident delight that\r\n",

      "he should hold the place in a good industrious way after all—by his taking to\r\n",
      "business. For it’s likely enough Bulstrode might let him go on, and gradually\r\n",
      "buy the stock. He hasn’t made up his mind, I can see, whether or not he shall\r\n",
      "settle somewhere else as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t know,” said Caleb, swinging his head aside. “Marriage is a taming\r\n",

      "debts, had been anxious to know whether her husband could not do something for\r\n",
      "poor Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him that Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan was to let them\r\n",
      "“take their course.” Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for the first time, “I think\r\n",
      "you are always a little hard towards my family, Nicholas. And I am sure I have\r\n",
      "no reason to deny any of my relatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever\r\n",
      "had to say that they were not respectable.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode’s remonstrance subsided into pity\r\n",

      "certain visits which he was making to Stone Court, in order to look more\r\n",
      "thoroughly into the state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary\r\n",
      "estimate. He was certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed\r\n",
      "of events required him to be; but he was stimulated by a fatherly delight in\r\n",

      "seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers droop\r\n",
      "between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it were sharing\r\n",
      "some thought which filled his large quiet brow.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his slowness in\r\n",
      "beginning to speak on any topic which he felt to be important, and rather\r\n",
      "expected that he was about to recur to the buying of some houses in Blindman’s\r\n",
      "Court, for the sake of pulling them down, as a sacrifice of property which\r\n",
      "would be well repaid by the influx of air and light on that spot. It was by\r\n",
      "propositions of this kind that Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his\r\n",
      "employers; but he had usually found Bulstrode ready to meet him in projects of\r\n",
      "improvement, and they had got on well together. When he spoke again, however,\r\n",
      "it was to say, in rather a subdued voice—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You found nothing wrong there, I hope,” said the banker; “I was there myself\r\n",
      "yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, yes,” said Caleb, looking up gravely, “there is something wrong—a\r\n",
      "stranger, who is very ill, I think. He wants a doctor, and I came to tell you\r\n",
      "of that. His name is Raffles.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He saw the shock of his words passing through Bulstrode’s frame. On this\r\n",
      "subject the banker had thought that his fears were too constantly on the watch\r\n",
      "to be taken by surprise; but he had been mistaken.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poor wretch!” he said in a compassionate tone, though his lips trembled a\r\n",
      "little. “Do you know how he came there?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I took him myself,” said Caleb, quietly—“took him up in my gig. He had got\r\n",
      "down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the turning from the\r\n",
      "toll-house, and I overtook him. He remembered seeing me with you once before,\r\n",
      "at Stone Court, and he asked me to take him on. I saw he was ill: it seemed to\r\n",
      "me the right thing to do, to carry him under shelter. And now I think you\r\n",
      "should lose no time in getting advice for him.” Caleb took up his hat from the\r\n",
      "floor as he ended, and rose slowly from his seat.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly,” said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.\r\n",
      "“Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr. Lydgate’s as\r\n",
      "you pass—or stay! he may at this hour probably be at the Hospital. I will first\r\n",
      "send my man on the horse there with a note this instant, and then I will myself\r\n",
      "ride to Stone Court.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the commission to\r\n",
      "his man. When he returned, Caleb was standing as before with one hand on the\r\n",
      "back of the chair, holding his hat with the other. In Bulstrode’s mind the\r\n",
      "dominant thought was, “Perhaps Raffles only spoke to Garth of his illness.\r\n",
      "Garth may wonder, as he must have done before, at this disreputable fellow’s\r\n",
      "claiming intimacy with me; but he will know nothing. And he is friendly to me—I\r\n",
      "can be of use to him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have asked\r\n",
      "any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been to betray\r\n",
      "fear.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,” he said, in his usual tone of\r\n",
      "politeness. “My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I shall then go\r\n",
      "myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man. Perhaps you had some\r\n",
      "other business with me? If so, pray be seated.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his right hand to waive\r\n",
      "the invitation. “I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must request you to put\r\n",
      "your business into some other hands than mine. I am obliged to you for your\r\n",
      "handsome way of meeting me—about the letting of Stone Court, and all other\r\n",
      "business. But I must give it up.” A sharp certainty entered like a stab into\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s soul.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is sudden, Mr. Garth,” was all he could say at first.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is,” said Caleb; “but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he could see that\r\n",
      "Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his face looking dried and his\r\n",
      "eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him. Caleb felt a deep pity\r\n",
      "for him, but he could have used no pretexts to account for his resolve, even if\r\n",
      "they would have been of any use.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me uttered\r\n",

      "\n",

      "“That is true. I can’t deny that I act upon what I heard from him.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth—a man, I trust, who feels himself\r\n",
      "accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being too ready to\r\n",
      "believe a slander,” said Bulstrode, casting about for pleas that might be\r\n",
      "adapted to his hearer’s mind. “That is a poor reason for giving up a connection\r\n",
      "which I think I may say will be mutually beneficial.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I would injure no man if I could help it,” said Caleb; “even if I thought God\r\n",
      "winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my fellow-creature. But, sir—I\r\n",
      "am obliged to believe that this Raffles has told me the truth. And I can’t be\r\n",
      "happy in working with you, or profiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg\r\n",
      "you to seek another agent.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst that he has\r\n",
      "told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am liable to be the victim\r\n",
      "of,” said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger beginning to mingle with his\r\n",
      "humiliation before this quiet man who renounced his benefits.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s needless,” said Caleb, waving his hand, bowing his head slightly, and\r\n",
      "not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful intention to spare this\r\n",
      "pitiable man. “What he has said to me will never pass from my lips, unless\r\n",
      "something now unknown forces it from me. If you led a harmful life for gain,\r\n",
      "and kept others out of their rights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I\r\n",
      "dare say you repent—you would like to go back, and can’t: that must be a bitter\r\n",
      "thing”—Caleb paused a moment and shook his head—“it is not for me to make your\r\n",
      "life harder to you.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you do—you do make it harder to me,” said Bulstrode constrained into a\r\n",
      "genuine, pleading cry. “You make it harder to me by turning your back on me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That I’m forced to do,” said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his hand. “I\r\n",
      "am sorry. I don’t judge you and say, he is wicked, and I am righteous. God\r\n",
      "forbid. I don’t know everything. A man may do wrong, and his will may rise\r\n",
      "clear out of it, though he can’t get his life clear. That’s a bad punishment.\r\n",
      "If it is so with you,—well, I’m very sorry for you. But I have that feeling\r\n",
      "inside me, that I can’t go on working with you. That’s all, Mr. Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "Everything else is buried, so far as my will goes. And I wish you good-day.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One moment, Mr. Garth!” said Bulstrode, hurriedly. “I may trust then to your\r\n",
      "solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or woman what—even if\r\n",
      "it have any degree of truth in it—is yet a malicious representation?” Caleb’s\r\n",
      "wrath was stirred, and he said, indignantly—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why should I have said it if I didn’t mean it? I am in no fear of you. Such\r\n",
      "tales as that will never tempt my tongue.”\r\n",

      "worse, when you profited by his vices.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are wronging me by too readily believing him,” said Bulstrode, oppressed,\r\n",
      "as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what Raffles might have\r\n",
      "said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had not so stated it to him as to\r\n",
      "ask for that flat denial.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Caleb, lifting his hand deprecatingly; “I am ready to believe\r\n",
      "better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance. As to speaking, I\r\n",
      "hold it a crime to expose a man’s sin unless I’m clear it must be done to save\r\n",
      "the innocent. That is my way of thinking, Mr. Bulstrode, and what I say, I’ve\r\n",
      "no need to swear. I wish you good-day.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some hours later, when he was at home, Caleb said to his wife, incidentally,\r\n",
      "that he had had some little differences with Bulstrode, and that in\r\n",
      "consequence, he had given up all notion of taking Stone Court, and indeed had\r\n",
      "resigned doing further business for him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was disposed to interfere too much, was he?” said Mrs. Garth, imagining\r\n",
      "that her husband had been touched on his sensitive point, and not been allowed\r\n",
      "to do what he thought right as to materials and modes of work.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh,” said Caleb, bowing his head and waving his hand gravely. And Mrs. Garth\r\n",
      "knew that this was a sign of his not intending to speak further on the subject.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Bulstrode, he had almost immediately mounted his horse and set off for\r\n",
      "Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language to his\r\n",
      "hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which shake our\r\n",
      "whole system. The deep humiliation with which he had winced under Caleb Garth’s\r\n",
      "knowledge of his past and rejection of his patronage, alternated with and\r\n",
      "almost gave way to the sense of safety in the fact that Garth, and no other,\r\n",
      "had been the man to whom Raffles had spoken. It seemed to him a sort of earnest\r\n",
      "that Providence intended his rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus\r\n",
      "left open for the hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with\r\n",
      "illness, that he should have been led to Stone Court rather than\r\n",
      "elsewhere—Bulstrode’s heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities which\r\n",
      "these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he was freed from all\r\n",
      "danger of disgrace—if he could breathe in perfect liberty—his life should be\r\n",
      "more consecrated than it had ever been before. He mentally lifted up this vow\r\n",
      "as if it would urge the result he longed for—he tried to believe in the potency\r\n",
      "of that prayerful resolution—its potency to determine death. He knew that he\r\n",
      "ought to say, “Thy will be done;” and he said it often. But the intense desire\r\n",
      "remained that the will of God might be the death of that hated man.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet when he arrived at Stone Court he could not see the change in Raffles\r\n",
      "without a shock. But for his pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode would have called\r\n",
      "the change in him entirely mental. Instead of his loud tormenting mood, he\r\n",
      "showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to deprecate Bulstrode’s anger,\r\n",
      "because the money was all gone—he had been robbed—it had half of it been taken\r\n",
      "from him. He had only come here because he was ill and somebody was hunting\r\n",
      "him—somebody was after him, he had told nobody anything, he had kept his mouth\r\n",
      "shut. Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted\r\n",
      "this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into true\r\n",
      "confessions, and taxed him with falsehood in saying that he had not told\r\n",
      "anything, since he had just told the man who took him up in his gig and brought\r\n",
      "him to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with solemn adjurations; the fact being\r\n",
      "that the links of consciousness were interrupted in him, and that his minute\r\n",
      "terror-stricken narrative to Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of\r\n",
      "visionary impulses which had dropped back into darkness.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s heart sank again at this sign that he could get no grasp over the\r\n",
      "wretched man’s mind, and that no word of Raffles could be trusted as to the\r\n",
      "fact which he most wanted to know, namely, whether or not he had really kept\r\n",
      "silence to every one in the neighborhood except Caleb Garth. The housekeeper\r\n",
      "had told him without the least constraint of manner that since Mr. Garth left,\r\n",
      "Raffles had asked her for beer, and after that had not spoken, seeming very\r\n",
      "ill. On that side it might be concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Abel thought, like the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to\r\n",
      "the unpleasant “kin” who are among the troubles of the rich; she had at first\r\n",
      "referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property left, the\r\n",
      "buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural enough. How he could\r\n",
      "be “kin” to Bulstrode as well was not so clear, but Mrs. Abel agreed with her\r\n",
      "husband that there was “no knowing,” a proposition which had a great deal of\r\n",
      "mental food for her, so that she shook her head over it without further\r\n",
      "speculation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In less than an hour Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met him outside the wainscoted\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once in my\r\n",
      "employment, many years ago. Afterwards he went to America, and returned I fear\r\n",
      "to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, he has a claim on me. He was\r\n",
      "slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of this place, and in\r\n",
      "consequence found his way here. I believe he is seriously ill: apparently his\r\n",
      "mind is affected. I feel bound to do the utmost for him.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate, who had the remembrance of his last conversation with Bulstrode\r\n",

      "bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just before entering the room he\r\n",
      "turned automatically and said, “What is his name?”—to know names being as much\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When he had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate ordered\r\n",
      "that he should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete quiet as possible,\r\n",

      "speak.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—and yes,” said Lydgate, half dubiously. “It is difficult to decide as to\r\n",
      "the possible effect of long-standing complications; but the man had a robust\r\n",
      "constitution to begin with. I should not expect this attack to be fatal, though\r\n",

      "fain have seen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will stirred\r\n",
      "murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by itself, had no\r\n",
      "power. He said inwardly that he was getting too much worn; he would not sit up\r\n",
      "with the patient to-night, but leave him to Mrs. Abel, who, if necessary, could\r\n",
      "call her husband.\r\n",

      "At six o’clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of sleep,\r\n",

      "sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium according to Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "directions. At the end of half an hour or more he called Mrs. Abel and told her\r\n",
      "that he found himself unfit for further watching. He must now consign the\r\n",
      "patient to her care; and he proceeded to repeat to her Lydgate’s directions as\r\n",
      "to the quantity of each dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s prescriptions; she had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode\r\n",
      "ordered, and had done what he pointed out to her. She began now to ask what\r\n",
      "else she should do besides administering the opium.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water: you can\r\n",
      "come to me for further directions. Unless there is any important change, I\r\n",
      "shall not come into the room again to-night. You will ask your husband for help\r\n",
      "if necessary. I must go to bed early.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve much need, sir, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Abel, “and to take something more\r\n",
      "strengthening than what you’ve done.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in his\r\n",
      "raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to create any\r\n",
      "dangerous belief. At any rate he must risk this. He went down into the\r\n",
      "wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he would not have his\r\n",
      "horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give up caring for earthly\r\n",
      "consequences. Then, he wished that he had begged Lydgate to come again that\r\n",
      "evening. Perhaps he might deliver a different opinion, and think that Raffles\r\n",
      "was getting into a less hopeful state. Should he send for Lydgate? If Raffles\r\n",
      "were really getting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he could go to\r\n",
      "bed and sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he worse? Lydgate might come\r\n",
      "and simply say that he was going on as he expected, and predict that he would\r\n",
      "by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was the use of sending for\r\n",
      "him? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No ideas or opinions could hinder him\r\n",
      "from seeing the one probability to be, that Raffles recovered would be just the\r\n",
      "same man as before, with his strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him to\r\n",
      "drag away his wife to spend her years apart from her friends and native place,\r\n",
      "carrying an alienating suspicion against him in her heart.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only, when a\r\n",
      "sudden thought made him rise and light the bed-candle, which he had brought\r\n",
      "down with him. The thought was, that he had not told Mrs. Abel when the doses\r\n",
      "of opium must cease.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while. She\r\n",
      "might already have given him more than Lydgate had prescribed. But it was\r\n",
      "excusable in him, that he should forget part of an order, in his present\r\n",
      "wearied condition. He walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not knowing whether he\r\n",
      "should straightway enter his own room and go to bed, or turn to the patient’s\r\n",
      "room and rectify his omission. He paused in the passage, with his face turned\r\n",
      "towards Raffles’s room, and he could hear him moaning and murmuring. He was not\r\n",
      "asleep, then. Who could know that Lydgate’s prescription would not be better\r\n",
      "disobeyed than followed, since there was still no sleep?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned into his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel rapped at\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the poor\r\n",
      "creetur? He feels sinking away, and nothing else will he swaller—and but little\r\n",
      "strength in it, if he did—only the opium. And he says more and more he’s\r\n",
      "sinking down through the earth.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To her surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on within\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think he must die for want o’ support, if he goes on in that way. When I\r\n",
      "nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him port-wine and brandy\r\n",
      "constant, and a big glass at a time,” added Mrs. Abel, with a touch of\r\n",
      "remonstrance in her tone.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she continued, “It’s\r\n",
      "not a time to spare when people are at death’s door, nor would you wish it,\r\n",
      "sir, I’m sure. Else I should give him our own bottle o’ rum as we keep by us.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode said\r\n",

      "there.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in the morning—about six—Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time in\r\n",
      "prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily\r\n",
      "candid—necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is inaudible\r\n",
      "speech, and speech is representative: who can represent himself just as he is,\r\n",
      "even in his own reflections? Bulstrode had not yet unravelled in his thought\r\n",
      "the confused promptings of the last four-and-twenty hours.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing. Then he\r\n",
      "walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the grass and fresh\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He’s gone very deep, sir,” said Mrs. Abel. “He went off gradual between three\r\n",
      "and four o’clock. Would you please to go and look at him? I thought it no harm\r\n",
      "to leave him. My man’s gone afield, and the little girl’s seeing to the\r\n",
      "kettles.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bulstrode went up. At a glance he knew that Raffles was not in the sleep which\r\n",

      "of death.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and the\r\n",
      "almost empty opium phial. He put the phial out of sight, and carried the\r\n",
      "brandy-bottle down-stairs with him, locking it again in the wine-cooler.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While breakfasting he considered whether he should ride to Middlemarch at once,\r\n",
      "or wait for Lydgate’s arrival. He decided to wait, and told Mrs. Abel that she\r\n",
      "might go about her work—he could watch in the bed-chamber.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he sat there and beheld the enemy of his peace going irrevocably into\r\n",
      "silence, he felt more at rest than he had done for many months. His conscience\r\n",
      "was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which seemed just then like an\r\n",
      "angel sent down for his relief. He drew out his pocket-book to review various\r\n",
      "memoranda there as to the arrangements he had projected and partly carried out\r\n",
      "in the prospect of quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he would let\r\n",
      "them stand or recall them, now that his absence would be brief. Some economies\r\n",
      "which he felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his temporary\r\n",
      "withdrawal from management, and he hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would take a\r\n",
      "large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the moments passed,\r\n",
      "until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked enough to draw his\r\n",
      "attention wholly to the bed, and forced him to think of the departing life,\r\n",
      "which had once been subservient to his own—which he had once been glad to find\r\n",
      "base enough for him to act on as he would. It was his gladness then which\r\n",
      "impelled him now to be glad that the life was at an end.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who knew what\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of the\r\n",
      "breath. When he entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden expression in his\r\n",
      "face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition that he had not judged\r\n",
      "correctly. He stood by the bed in silence for some time, with his eyes turned\r\n",
      "on the dying man, but with that subdued activity of expression which showed\r\n",
      "that he was carrying on an inward debate.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When did this change begin?” said he, looking at Bulstrode.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not watch by him last night,” said Bulstrode. “I was over-worn, and left\r\n",
      "him under Mrs. Abel’s care. She said that he sank into sleep between three and\r\n",
      "four o’clock. When I came in before eight he was nearly in this condition.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he said,\r\n",
      "“It’s all over.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He had set\r\n",
      "out on his work with all his old animation, and felt himself strong enough to\r\n",
      "bear all the deficiencies of his married life. And he was conscious that\r\n",
      "Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him. But he was uneasy about this case. He\r\n",
      "had not expected it to terminate as it had done. Yet he hardly knew how to put\r\n",
      "a question on the subject to Bulstrode without appearing to insult him; and if\r\n",
      "he examined the housekeeper—why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in\r\n",
      "implying that somebody’s ignorance or imprudence had killed him. And after all,\r\n",
      "he himself might be wrong.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many\r\n",
      "things—chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House of\r\n",
      "Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was said about\r\n",
      "Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of having a grave for\r\n",
      "him in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far as he knew, the poor man\r\n",
      "had no connections, except Rigg, whom he had stated to be unfriendly towards\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar had not\r\n",
      "been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an execution in\r\n",
      "Lydgate’s house had got to Lowick by the evening, having been carried by Mr.\r\n",
      "Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from his brother, the\r\n",
      "respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that evening when Lydgate had\r\n",
      "come down from the billiard room with Fred Vincy, Mr. Farebrother’s thoughts\r\n",
      "about him had been rather gloomy. Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener\r\n",
      "might have been a trifle in another man; but in Lydgate it was one of several\r\n",
      "signs that he was getting unlike his former self. He was beginning to do things\r\n",
      "for which he had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain\r\n",
      "dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had given\r\n",
      "him hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother felt sure that\r\n",
      "it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being more and more\r\n",
      "distinctly reported, and he began to fear that any notion of Lydgate’s having\r\n",
      "resources or friends in the background must be quite illusory. The rebuff he\r\n",
      "had met with in his first attempt to win Lydgate’s confidence, disinclined him\r\n",
      "to a second; but this news of the execution being actually in the house,\r\n",
      "determined the Vicar to overcome his reluctance.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he was much interested, and\r\n",
      "he came forward to put out his hand—with an open cheerfulness which surprised\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a proud rejection of sympathy and help?\r\n",
      "Never mind; the sympathy and help should be offered.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something which\r\n",
      "made me anxious about you,” said the Vicar, in the tone of a good brother, only\r\n",
      "that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated by this time, and\r\n",
      "Lydgate answered immediately—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an execution in the\r\n",
      "house?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; is it true?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was true,” said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he did not mind\r\n",
      "talking about the affair now. “But the danger is over; the debt is paid. I am\r\n",
      "out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts, and able, I hope, to\r\n",
      "start afresh on a better plan.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very thankful to hear it,” said the Vicar, falling back in his chair, and\r\n",
      "speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows the removal of a\r\n",
      "load. “I like that better than all the news in the ‘Times.’ I confess I came to\r\n",
      "you with a heavy heart.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you for coming,” said Lydgate, cordially. “I can enjoy the kindness all\r\n",
      "the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a good deal crushed. I’m\r\n",
      "afraid I shall find the bruises still painful by-and by,” he added, smiling\r\n",
      "rather sadly; “but just now I can only feel that the torture-screw is off.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, “My dear\r\n",
      "fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a liberty.”\r\n",

      "hereafter?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Lydgate, coloring slightly. “There is no reason why I should not\r\n",
      "tell you—since the fact is so—that the person to whom I am indebted is\r\n",
      "Bulstrode. He has made me a very handsome advance—a thousand pounds—and he can\r\n",
      "afford to wait for repayment.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is generous,” said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to approve\r\n",
      "of the man whom he disliked. His delicate feeling shrank from dwelling even in\r\n",
      "his thought on the fact that he had always urged Lydgate to avoid any personal\r\n",
      "entanglement with Bulstrode. He added immediately, “And Bulstrode must\r\n",
      "naturally feel an interest in your welfare, after you have worked with him in a\r\n",
      "way which has probably reduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad\r\n",
      "to think that he has acted accordingly.”\r\n",

      "stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode’s motives for his sudden\r\n",
      "beneficence following close upon the chillest indifference might be merely\r\n",
      "selfish. He let the kindly suppositions pass. He could not tell the history of\r\n",
      "the loan, but it was more vividly present with him than ever, as well as the\r\n",
      "fact which the Vicar delicately ignored—that this relation of personal\r\n",
      "indebtedness to Bulstrode was what he had once been most resolved to avoid.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can give it him free of\r\n",

      "fore-finger. “He was at Larcher’s sale, but I knew nothing of him then—he\r\n",

      "and ditch with him, till he’d brag of a spavin as if it ’ud fetch money. A man\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Go on, Bambridge,” said Mr. Hawley, insistently. “What did this fellow say\r\n",
      "about Bulstrode?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded the betrayal of—and hoped\r\n",
      "to have buried forever with the corpse of Raffles—it was that haunting ghost of\r\n",
      "his earlier life which as he rode past the archway of the Green Dragon he was\r\n",
      "trusting that Providence had delivered him from. Yes, Providence. He had not\r\n",
      "confessed to himself yet that he had done anything in the way of contrivance to\r\n",
      "this end; he had accepted what seemed to have been offered. It was impossible\r\n",

      "could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring about hay, but really to\r\n",
      "gather all that could be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel.\r\n",
      "In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to\r\n",
      "Stone Court in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of\r\n",
      "seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether he had time to undertake an\r\n",
      "arbitration if it were required, and then asking him incidentally about\r\n",
      "Raffles. Caleb was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact\r\n",
      "which he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the\r\n",
      "last week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Raffles\r\n",
      "had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode’s affairs in\r\n",
      "consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller. The statement was passed\r\n",
      "on until it had quite lost the stamp of an inference, and was taken as\r\n",
      "information coming straight from Garth, so that even a diligent historian might\r\n",
      "have concluded Caleb to be the chief publisher of Bulstrode’s misdemeanors.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the law either\r\n",
      "in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances of his death. He had\r\n",
      "himself ridden to Lowick village that he might look at the register and talk\r\n",
      "over the whole matter with Mr. Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the\r\n",
      "lawyer that an ugly secret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he\r\n",
      "had always had justice enough in him to hinder his antipathy from turning into\r\n",
      "conclusions. But while they were talking another combination was silently going\r\n",
      "forward in Mr. Farebrother’s mind, which foreshadowed what was soon to be\r\n",
      "loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary “putting of two and two\r\n",
      "together.” With the reasons which kept Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there\r\n",
      "flashed the thought that the dread might have something to do with his\r\n",
      "munificence towards his medical man; and though he resisted the suggestion that\r\n",
      "it had been consciously accepted in any way as a bribe, he had a foreboding\r\n",
      "that this complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "reputation. He perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of the sudden\r\n",
      "relief from debt, and he himself was careful to glide away from all approaches\r\n",
      "towards the subject.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” he said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable\r\n",
      "discussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally proven, “it\r\n",
      "is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer genealogy! A\r\n",
      "high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot made a likely enough\r\n",
      "stock for him to spring from, but I should never have suspected a grafting of\r\n",
      "the Jew pawnbroker. However, there’s no knowing what a mixture will turn out\r\n",
      "beforehand. Some sorts of dirt serve to clarify.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s just what I should have expected,” said Mr. Hawley, mounting his horse.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know he’s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he is really a disinterested,\r\n",
      "unworldly fellow,” said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,” said Mr. Hawley, who had been in the\r\n",
      "habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned pleasant\r\n",
      "good-hearted fellow you would mistake him for a Tory.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate’s attendance on Raffles in any\r\n",
      "other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of Bulstrode. But the news\r\n",
      "that Lydgate had all at once become able not only to get rid of the execution\r\n",
      "in his house but to pay all his debts in Middlemarch was spreading fast,\r\n",
      "gathering round it conjectures and comments which gave it new body and impetus,\r\n",
      "and soon filling the ears of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not\r\n",
      "slow to see a significant relation between this sudden command of money and\r\n",
      "Bulstrode’s desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money came from\r\n",
      "Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there had been no direct\r\n",
      "evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into the gossip about Lydgate’s\r\n",
      "affairs, that neither his father-in-law nor his own family would do anything\r\n",
      "for him, and direct evidence was furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but\r\n",
      "by innocent Mrs. Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale,\r\n",
      "who mentioned it to her daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who mentioned\r\n",
      "it generally. The business was felt to be so public and important that it\r\n",
      "required dinners to feed it, and many invitations were just then issued and\r\n",
      "accepted on the strength of this scandal concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate;\r\n",
      "wives, widows, and single ladies took their work and went out to tea oftener\r\n",
      "than usual; and all public conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop’s,\r\n",
      "gathered a zest which could not be won from the question whether the Lords\r\n",
      "would throw out the Reform Bill.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at the\r\n",
      "bottom of Bulstrode’s liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in the first\r\n",
      "instance, invited a select party, including the two physicians, with Mr Toller\r\n",
      "and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close discussion as to the probabilities of\r\n",
      "Raffles’s illness, reciting to them all the particulars which had been gathered\r\n",
      "from Mrs. Abel in connection with Lydgate’s certificate, that the death was due\r\n",
      "to delirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood undisturbedly on\r\n",
      "the old paths in relation to this disease, declared that they could see nothing\r\n",
      "in these particulars which could be transformed into a positive ground of\r\n",
      "suspicion. But the moral grounds of suspicion remained: the strong motives\r\n",
      "Bulstrode clearly had for wishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at\r\n",
      "this critical moment he had given Lydgate the help which he must for some time\r\n",
      "have known the need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode\r\n",
      "would be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe that\r\n",
      "Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when they have\r\n",
      "found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had been given merely to\r\n",
      "make him hold his tongue about the scandal of Bulstrode’s earlier life, the\r\n",
      "fact threw an odious light on Lydgate, who had long been sneered at as making\r\n",
      "himself subservient to the banker for the sake of working himself into\r\n",
      "predominance, and discrediting the elder members of his profession. Hence, in\r\n",
      "spite of the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death\r\n",
      "at Stone Court, Mr. Hawley’s select party broke up with the sense that the\r\n",
      "affair had “an ugly look.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to keep up\r\n",
      "much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial professional\r\n",
      "seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power of mystery over fact.\r\n",
      "Everybody liked better to conjecture how the thing was, than simply to know it;\r\n",
      "for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge, and had a more\r\n",
      "liberal allowance for the incompatible. Even the more definite scandal\r\n",
      "concerning Bulstrode’s earlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass\r\n",
      "of mystery, as so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take\r\n",
      "such fantastic shapes as heaven pleased.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the spirited\r\n",
      "landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to resist the shallow\r\n",
      "pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their reports from the outer\r\n",

      "sure there was not strength enough in him to walk away without support. What\r\n",
      "could he do? He could not see a man sink close to him for want of help. He rose\r\n",
      "and gave his arm to Bulstrode, and in that way led him out of the room; yet\r\n",
      "this act, which might have been one of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at\r\n",
      "this moment unspeakably bitter to him. It seemed as if he were putting his\r\n",
      "sign-manual to that association of himself with Bulstrode, of which he now saw\r\n",
      "the full meaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He now felt\r\n",
      "the conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his arm, had given\r\n",
      "him the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the treatment of Raffles\r\n",
      "had been tampered with from an evil motive. The inferences were closely linked\r\n",
      "enough; the town knew of the loan, believed it to be a bribe, and believed that\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent sadness in talking to Mr.\r\n",

      "to marriage with an interloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they\r\n",
      "lay on the surface: there was never anything bad to be “found out” concerning\r\n",

      "seeming to palliate his culpability. Again, the late alliance of her family\r\n",
      "with the Tollers had brought her in connection with the best circle, which\r\n",
      "gratified her in every direction except in the inclination to those serious\r\n",
      "views which she believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little\r\n",
      "woman’s conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these opposing\r\n",
      "“bests,” and of her griefs and satisfactions under late events, which were\r\n",
      "likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also to fall heavily on her old\r\n",

      "That the hateful man had come ill to Stone Court, and that her husband had\r\n",
      "chosen to remain there and watch over him, she allowed to be explained by the\r\n",
      "fact that Raffles had been employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this\r\n",
      "made a tie of benevolence towards him in his degraded helplessness; and she had\r\n",
      "been since then innocently cheered by her husband’s more hopeful speech about\r\n",
      "his own health and ability to continue his attention to business. The calm was\r\n",
      "disturbed when Lydgate had brought him home ill from the meeting, and in spite\r\n",
      "of comforting assurances during the next few days, she cried in private from\r\n",
      "the conviction that her husband was not suffering from bodily illness merely,\r\n",
      "but from something that afflicted his mind. He would not allow her to read to\r\n",
      "him, and scarcely to sit with him, alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds\r\n",
      "and movements; yet she suspected that in shutting himself up in his private\r\n",
      "room he wanted to be busy with his papers. Something, she felt sure, had\r\n",
      "happened. Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she was kept in the\r\n",
      "dark. Not daring to question her husband, she said to Lydgate, on the fifth day\r\n",
      "after the meeting, when she had not left home except to go to church—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has anything\r\n",
      "happened to Mr. Bulstrode?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some little nervous shock,” said Lydgate, evasively. He felt that it was not\r\n",
      "for him to make the painful revelation.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "of their systems. It is often impossible to account for the precise moment of\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in her the\r\n",
      "belief that some calamity had befallen her husband, of which she was to be kept\r\n",
      "in ignorance; and it was in her nature strongly to object to such concealment.\r\n",
      "She begged leave for her daughters to sit with their father, and drove into the\r\n",
      "town to pay some visits, conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone\r\n",
      "wrong in Mr. Bulstrode’s affairs, she should see or hear some sign of it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Hackbutt’s on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw her coming\r\n",
      "from an up-stairs window, and remembering her former alarm lest she should meet\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency to send word that she was not\r\n",
      "at home; but against that, there was a sudden strong desire within her for the\r\n",
      "excitement of an interview in which she was quite determined not to make the\r\n",
      "slightest allusion to what was in her mind.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt went to\r\n",
      "her, with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her hands than was usually\r\n",
      "observable in her, these being precautions adopted against freedom of speech.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried in it,”\r\n",

      "thunder ready to bolt on her head, and she herself could do no more than\r\n",
      "prepare her a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly rather chill and trembling:\r\n",
      "there was evidently something unusual behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt’s;\r\n",
      "but though she had set out with the desire to be fully informed, she found\r\n",
      "herself unable now to pursue her brave purpose, and turning the conversation by\r\n",
      "an inquiry about the young Hackbutts, she soon took her leave saying that she\r\n",
      "was going to see Mrs. Plymdale. On her way thither she tried to imagine that\r\n",
      "there might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.\r\n",
      "Bulstrode and some of his frequent opponents—perhaps Mr. Hackbutt might have\r\n",
      "been one of them. That would account for everything.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when she was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting explanation\r\n",
      "seemed no longer tenable. “Selina” received her with a pathetic\r\n",
      "affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on the commonest\r\n",
      "topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary quarrel of which the\r\n",
      "most important consequence was a perturbation of Mr. Bulstrode’s health.\r\n",
      "Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she would sooner question Mrs.\r\n",
      "Plymdale than any one else; but she found to her surprise that an old friend is\r\n",
      "not always the person whom it is easiest to make a confidant of: there was the\r\n",
      "barrier of remembered communication under other circumstances—there was the\r\n",
      "dislike of being pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her\r\n",
      "the superiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Plymdale let fall about her resolution never to turn her back on her friends,\r\n",
      "convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be some kind of\r\n",
      "misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her native directness, “What\r\n",
      "is it that you have in your mind?” she found herself anxious to get away before\r\n",
      "she had heard anything more explicit. She began to have an agitating certainty\r\n",
      "that the misfortune was something more than the mere loss of money, being\r\n",
      "keenly sensitive to the fact that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done\r\n",
      "before, avoided noticing what she said about her husband, as they would have\r\n",
      "avoided noticing a personal blemish.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to Mr.\r\n",
      "Vincy’s warehouse. In that short drive her dread gathered so much force from\r\n",
      "the sense of darkness, that when she entered the private counting-house where\r\n",
      "her brother sat at his desk, her knees trembled and her usually florid face was\r\n",
      "deathly pale. Something of the same effect was produced in him by the sight of\r\n",
      "her: he rose from his seat to meet her, took her by the hand, and said, with\r\n",
      "his impulsive rashness—\r\n",

      "“God help you, Harriet! you know all.”\r\n",

      "That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained that\r\n",
      "concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals the bias of a\r\n",
      "nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will end an intermediate\r\n",
      "struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she might still have thought only of\r\n",
      "monetary ruin, but now along with her brother’s look and words there darted\r\n",
      "into her mind the idea of some guilt in her husband—then, under the working of\r\n",
      "terror came the image of her husband exposed to disgrace—and then, after an\r\n",
      "instant of scorching shame in which she felt only the eyes of the world, with\r\n",
      "one leap of her heart she was at his side in mournful but unreproaching\r\n",
      "fellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her in a mere\r\n",
      "flash of time—while she sank into the chair, and raised her eyes to her\r\n",
      "brother, who stood over her. “I know nothing, Walter. What is it?” she said,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“People will talk,” he said. “Even if a man has been acquitted by a jury,\r\n",
      "they’ll talk, and nod and wink—and as far as the world goes, a man might often\r\n",
      "as well be guilty as not. It’s a breakdown blow, and it damages Lydgate as much\r\n",
      "as Bulstrode. I don’t pretend to say what is the truth. I only wish we had\r\n",

      "before Will’s departure. He would have made, she thought, a much more suitable\r\n",
      "husband for her than she had found in Lydgate. No notion could have been falser\r\n",
      "than this, for Rosamond’s discontent in her marriage was due to the conditions\r\n",

      "to the nature of her husband; but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a\r\n",
      "sentimental charm which diverted her ennui. She constructed a little romance\r\n",
      "which was to vary the flatness of her life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a\r\n",
      "bachelor and live near her, always to be at her command, and have an understood\r\n",
      "though never fully expressed passion for her, which would be sending out\r\n",
      "lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes. His departure had been\r\n",
      "a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly increased her weariness of\r\n",
      "Middlemarch; but at first she had the alternative dream of pleasures in store\r\n",
      "from her intercourse with the family at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of\r\n",

      "after the meeting, and without speaking to him on the subject, to send out\r\n",
      "notes of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this was\r\n",
      "a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them, and\r\n",
      "wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When the invitations had been\r\n",
      "accepted, she would tell Lydgate, and give him a wise admonition as to how a\r\n",

      "His indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she\r\n",

      "with a husband disposed to offend everybody. It was after the dinner hour, and\r\n",
      "she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They\r\n",
      "greeted her with sad looks, saying “Well, my dear!” and no more. She had never\r\n",

      "remember that he was in a morbid state of mind, in which almost all contact was\r\n",
      "pain. Certainly Rosamond in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve\r\n",

      "had not come forward. He had begun to question her with the intent that their\r\n",
      "conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them, but\r\n",
      "he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment. Even this trouble,\r\n",
      "like the rest, she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone. He was always to\r\n",
      "her a being apart, doing what she objected to. He started from his chair with\r\n",
      "an angry impulse, and thrusting his hands in his pockets, walked up and down\r\n",
      "the room. There was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should\r\n",
      "have to master this anger, and tell her everything, and convince her of the\r\n",
      "facts. For he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her\r\n",
      "nature, and that because she came short in her sympathy, he must give the more.\r\n",
      "Soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself: the occasion must not be\r\n",
      "lost. If he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander\r\n",
      "which must be met and not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come\r\n",
      "out of his desperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully\r\n",
      "on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as\r\n",
      "possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves\r\n",
      "independent. He would mention the definite measures which he desired to take,\r\n",
      "and win her to a willing spirit. He was bound to try this—and what else was\r\n",
      "there for him to do?\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards,\r\n",

      "its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see\r\n",
      "things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be\r\n",
      "seen and judged in the wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning\r\n",
      "to act on Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is\r\n",
      "dragged and struggling amid the throng. He sat down again, and felt that he was\r\n",

      "hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of life in him. But I\r\n",
      "should like to tell you everything. It will be a comfort to me to speak where\r\n",
      "belief has gone beforehand, and where I shall not seem to be offering\r\n",

      "clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way guilty. Mr. Farebrother\r\n",
      "would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James Chettam. Nay, there are persons\r\n",

      "searching tenderness of her woman’s tones seemed made for a defence against\r\n",
      "ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think that she was Quixotic: he gave\r\n",
      "himself up, for the first time in his life, to the exquisite sense of leaning\r\n",
      "entirely on a generous sympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he\r\n",
      "told her everything, from the time when, under the pressure of his\r\n",
      "difficulties, he unwillingly made his first application to Bulstrode;\r\n",
      "gradually, in the relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of\r\n",
      "what had gone on in his mind—entering fully into the fact that his treatment of\r\n",
      "the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his doubts at the last,\r\n",
      "his ideal of medical duty, and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of\r\n",
      "the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional\r\n",
      "behavior, though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It has come to my knowledge since,” he added, “that Hawley sent some one to\r\n",
      "examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she said that she gave the patient\r\n",
      "all the opium in the phial I left, as well as a good deal of brandy. But that\r\n",
      "would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions, even of first-rate men.\r\n",
      "The suspicions against me had no hold there: they are grounded on the knowledge\r\n",
      "that I took money, that Bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to\r\n",
      "die, and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or\r\n",
      "other against the patient—that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my\r\n",
      "tongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately, because\r\n",
      "they lie in people’s inclination and can never be disproved. How my orders came\r\n",
      "to be disobeyed is a question to which I don’t know the answer. It is still\r\n",
      "possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any criminal intention—even possible\r\n",
      "that he had nothing to do with the disobedience, and merely abstained from\r\n",
      "mentioning it. But all that has nothing to do with the public belief. It is one\r\n",
      "of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character—it is\r\n",
      "believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had\r\n",
      "the motive for doing it; and Bulstrode’s character has enveloped me, because I\r\n",
      "took his money. I am simply blighted—like a damaged ear of corn—the business is\r\n",
      "done and can’t be undone.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it is hard!” said Dorothea. “I understand the difficulty there is in your\r\n",
      "vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to you who had meant\r\n",
      "to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out better ways—I cannot\r\n",
      "bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know you meant that. I remember what\r\n",
      "you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital. There is no\r\n",
      "sorrow I have thought more about than that—to love what is great, and try to\r\n",
      "reach it, and yet to fail.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Lydgate, feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning\r\n",
      "of his grief. “I had some ambition. I meant everything to be different with me.\r\n",
      "I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the most terrible obstacles are\r\n",
      "such as nobody can see except oneself.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Suppose,” said Dorothea, meditatively,—“suppose we kept on the Hospital\r\n",
      "according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only with the\r\n",
      "friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you would gradually\r\n",
      "die out; there would come opportunities in which people would be forced to\r\n",
      "acknowledge that they had been unjust to you, because they would see that your\r\n",
      "purposes were pure. You may still win a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I\r\n",
      "have heard you speak of, and we shall all be proud of you,” she ended, with a\r\n",
      "smile.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That might do if I had my old trust in myself,” said Lydgate, mournfully.\r\n",
      "“Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and running away before\r\n",
      "this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me. Still, I can’t ask any one to put\r\n",
      "a great deal of money into a plan which depends on me.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be quite worth my while,” said Dorothea, simply. “Only think. I am\r\n",
      "very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I have too little for\r\n",
      "any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I have too much. I don’t know\r\n",
      "what to do. I have seven hundred a-year of my own fortune, and nineteen hundred\r\n",
      "a-year that Mr. Casaubon left me, and between three and four thousand of ready\r\n",
      "money in the bank. I wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my\r\n",
      "income which I don’t want, to buy land with and found a village which should be\r\n",
      "a school of industry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that the\r\n",
      "risk would be too great. So you see that what I should most rejoice at would be\r\n",
      "to have something good to do with my money: I should like it to make other\r\n",
      "people’s lives better to them. It makes me very uneasy—coming all to me who\r\n",
      "don’t want it.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate’s face. The childlike grave-eyed\r\n",
      "earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was irresistible—blent into an\r\n",
      "adorable whole with her ready understanding of high experience. (Of lower\r\n",
      "experience such as plays a great part in the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a\r\n",
      "very blurred shortsighted knowledge, little helped by her imagination.) But she\r\n",
      "took the smile as encouragement of her plan.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,” she said, in a tone of\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and she sat in\r\n",

      "considering my wife’s happiness. The thing that I might like to do if I were\r\n",
      "alone, is become impossible to me. I can’t see her miserable. She married me\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And she has set her mind against staying. She wishes to go. The troubles she\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She would not see it,” he said at last, curtly, feeling at first that this\r\n",
      "statement must do without explanation. “And, indeed, I have lost all spirit\r\n",
      "about carrying on my life here.” He paused a moment and then, following the\r\n",
      "impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the difficulty of his life, he said,\r\n",
      "“The fact is, this trouble has come upon her confusedly. We have not been able\r\n",
      "to speak to each other about it. I am not sure what is in her mind about it:\r\n",
      "she may fear that I have really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "I would tell her that you have not been blamable before any one’s judgment but\r\n",
      "your own. I would tell her that you shall be cleared in every fair mind. I\r\n",
      "would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her\r\n",
      "once.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure you may,” said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some hope. “She\r\n",
      "would feel honored—cheered, I think, by the proof that you at least have some\r\n",
      "respect for me. I will not speak to her about your coming—that she may not\r\n",
      "connect it with my wishes at all. I know very well that I ought not to have\r\n",

      "whom his love held him in dread, that it was his love for her only which he was\r\n",

      "proud delight in his delicate sense of honor and his determination that no one\r\n",

      "that simplicity of hers, holding up an ideal for others in her believing\r\n",

      "very sinful in her to keep up an inward wail because she was not completely\r\n",

      "and dine at the parsonage on her return from Freshitt. There was a frequent\r\n",
      "interchange of visits between her and the Farebrother family, which enabled her\r\n",

      "grief, but could sit down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer\r\n",

      "nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the narrow cell\r\n",
      "of her calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness that only sees\r\n",

      "alone in that scene? Was it her event only? She forced herself to think of it\r\n",
      "as bound up with another woman’s life—a woman towards whom she had set out with\r\n",
      "a longing to carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth. In her\r\n",
      "first outleap of jealous indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful\r\n",
      "room, she had flung away all the mercy with which she had undertaken that\r\n",
      "visit. She had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her burning scorn, and it\r\n",
      "seemed to her as if Rosamond were burned out of her sight forever. But that\r\n",
      "base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a faithless\r\n",
      "lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when the dominant\r\n",
      "spirit of justice within her had once overcome the tumult and had once shown\r\n",
      "her the truer measure of things. All the active thought with which she had\r\n",
      "before been representing to herself the trials of Lydgate’s lot, and this young\r\n",
      "marriage union which, like her own, seemed to have its hidden as well as\r\n",
      "evident troubles—all this vivid sympathetic experience returned to her now as a\r\n",
      "power: it asserted itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let\r\n",
      "us see as we saw in the day of our ignorance. She said to her own irremediable\r\n",
      "grief, that it should make her more helpful, instead of driving her back from\r\n",
      "effort.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact with\r\n",

      "sacred branch? The objects of her rescue were not to be sought out by her\r\n",
      "fancy: they were chosen for her. She yearned towards the perfect Right, that it\r\n",
      "might make a throne within her, and rule her errant will. “What should I do—how\r\n",
      "should I act now, this very day, if I could clutch my own pain, and compel it\r\n",
      "to silence, and think of those three?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had taken long for her to come to that question, and there was light\r\n",
      "piercing into the room. She opened her curtains, and looked out towards the bit\r\n",
      "of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside the entrance-gates. On the\r\n",
      "road there was a man with a bundle on his back and a woman carrying her baby;\r\n",
      "in the field she could see figures moving—perhaps the shepherd with his dog.\r\n",
      "Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of\r\n",
      "the world and the manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She was a\r\n",
      "part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it\r\n",
      "from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish\r\n",
      "complaining.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What she would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but\r\n",
      "something that she could achieve stirred her as with an approaching murmur\r\n",
      "which would soon gather distinctness. She took off the clothes which seemed to\r\n",
      "have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them, and began to make her\r\n",
      "toilet. Presently she rang for Tantripp, who came in her dressing-gown.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, madam, you’ve never been in bed this blessed night,” burst out Tantripp,\r\n",
      "looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea’s face, which in spite of bathing\r\n",
      "had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater dolorosa. “You’ll kill\r\n",
      "yourself, you will. Anybody might think now you had a right to give\r\n",
      "yourself a little comfort.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be alarmed, Tantripp,” said Dorothea, smiling. “I have slept; I am not\r\n",
      "ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible. And I want you to\r\n",
      "bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want my new bonnet to-day.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“They’ve lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most thankful I\r\n",

      "Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. “There’s a reason in mourning, as I’ve\r\n",
      "always said; and three folds at the bottom of your skirt and a plain quilling\r\n",
      "in your bonnet—and if ever anybody looked like an angel, it’s you in a net\r\n",
      "quilling—is what’s consistent for a second year. At least, that’s my\r\n",
      "thinking,” ended Tantripp, looking anxiously at the fire; “and if anybody was\r\n",
      "to marry me flattering himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years\r\n",
      "for him, he’d be deceived by his own vanity, that’s all.”\r\n",

      "she had waived before. Tantripp would never have found the clew to this\r\n",
      "mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge that she had not the less an active\r\n",
      "life before her because she had buried a private joy; and the tradition that\r\n",
      "fresh garments belonged to all initiation, haunting her mind, made her grasp\r\n",

      "contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear\r\n",
      "impossible. To a creature of Will’s susceptible temperament—without any neutral\r\n",
      "region of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him\r\n",
      "into the collisions of a passionate drama—the revelation that Rosamond had made\r\n",
      "her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst\r\n",
      "of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him. He hated his own\r\n",

      "her again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness\r\n",
      "was a power which he dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste of\r\n",
      "enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he\r\n",
      "was making his fresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he\r\n",

      "to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But there were\r\n",

      "happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had\r\n",
      "remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh\r\n",

      "no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had written to him would\r\n",

      "if she had a great deal of superfluous strength—that is to say, more strength\r\n",

      "there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was well and had\r\n",
      "flannel; nobody’s pig had died; and it was Saturday morning, when there was a\r\n",
      "general scrubbing of doors and door-stones, and when it was useless to go into\r\n",
      "the school. But there were various subjects that Dorothea was trying to get\r\n",
      "clear upon, and she resolved to throw herself energetically into the gravest of\r\n",
      "all. She sat down in the library before her particular little heap of books on\r\n",
      "political economy and kindred matters, out of which she was trying to get light\r\n",
      "as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one’s neighbors,\r\n",
      "or—what comes to the same thing—so as to do them the most good. Here was a\r\n",
      "weighty subject which, if she could but lay hold of it, would certainly keep\r\n",
      "her mind steady. Unhappily her mind slipped off it for a whole hour; and at the\r\n",
      "end she found herself reading sentences twice over with an intense\r\n",
      "consciousness of many things, but not of any one thing contained in the text.\r\n",
      "This was hopeless. Should she order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for\r\n",
      "some reason or other she preferred staying at Lowick. But her vagrant mind must\r\n",
      "be reduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she walked round\r\n",
      "and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre she could\r\n",
      "arrest her wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the best means—something\r\n",
      "to which she must go doggedly. Was there not the geography of Asia Minor, in\r\n",
      "which her slackness had often been rebuked by Mr. Casaubon? She went to the\r\n",
      "cabinet of maps and unrolled one: this morning she might make herself finally\r\n",
      "sure that Paphlagonia was not on the Levantine coast, and fix her total\r\n",
      "darkness about the Chalybes firmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a\r\n",
      "fine thing to study when you were disposed to think of something else, being\r\n",
      "made up of names that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them.\r\n",
      "Dorothea set earnestly to work, bending close to her map, and uttering the\r\n",
      "names in an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime. She looked\r\n",
      "amusingly girlish after all her deep experience—nodding her head and marking\r\n",
      "the names off on her fingers, with a little pursing of her lip, and now and\r\n",

      "attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified unconsciousness. What\r\n",
      "she was least conscious of just then was her own body: she was thinking of what\r\n",

      "helped to bring me down here again. At least I thought it excused my coming. It\r\n",
      "was the idea of getting Bulstrode to apply some money to a public purpose—some\r\n",
      "money which he had thought of giving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode’s\r\n",
      "credit that he privately offered me compensation for an old injury: he offered\r\n",

      "himself from the intolerable durance of formality to which he had been for the\r\n",
      "first time condemned in Dorothea’s presence. It must be confessed that he felt\r\n",
      "very happy at that moment leaning on the chair. He was not much afraid of\r\n",

      "which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside of their leaves\r\n",
      "against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the prospect of a storm so much:\r\n",
      "it delivered him from the necessity of going away. Leaves and little branches\r\n",
      "were hurled about, and the thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and\r\n",
      "more sombre, but there came a flash of lightning which made them start and look\r\n",
      "at each other, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she had been thinking\r\n",
      "of.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing to try\r\n",

      "that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed to see that more clearly\r\n",
      "than ever, when I was the most wretched. I can hardly think how I could have\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I have felt worse—it was worse to think ill—” Dorothea had begun\r\n",
      "impetuously, but broke off.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Will colored. He had the sense that whatever she said was uttered in the vision\r\n",

      "passionately—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without disguise.\r\n",

      "Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will followed her, seizing her\r\n",
      "hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they stood, with their hands clasped,\r\n",
      "like two children, looking out on the storm, while the thunder gave a\r\n",
      "tremendous crack and roll above them, and the rain began to pour down. Then\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room, and with her hands folded over each other on her lap, looked at\r\n",
      "the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant looking at her, then seated\r\n",
      "himself beside her, and laid his hand on hers, which turned itself upward to be\r\n",
      "clasped. They sat in that way without looking at each other, until the rain\r\n",
      "abated and began to fall in stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which\r\n",
      "neither of them could begin to utter.\r\n",

      "said, “It is impossible!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be battling\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,” he burst\r\n",

      "“Yes, it must,” said Will, angrily. “It is cruel of you to speak in that way—as\r\n",
      "if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery of it, but I don’t. It\r\n",
      "is unkind—it is throwing back my love for you as if it were a trifle, to speak\r\n",
      "in that way in the face of the fact. We can never be married.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some time—we might,” said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When?” said Will, bitterly. “What is the use of counting on any success of\r\n",
      "mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more than keep myself\r\n",
      "decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere pen and a mouthpiece. I can\r\n",

      "no luxuries to renounce.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was silence. Dorothea’s heart was full of something that she wanted to\r\n",

      "that moment debate was mute within her. And it was very hard that she could not\r\n",
      "say what she wanted to say. Will was looking out of the window angrily. If he\r\n",
      "would have looked at her and not gone away from her side, she thought\r\n",
      "everything would have been easier. At last he turned, still resting against the\r\n",

      "days ago—not any idea, you know. There’s something singular in things. But\r\n",
      "Dorothea is quite determined—it is no use opposing. I put it strongly to her. I\r\n",
      "did my duty, Chettam. But she can act as she likes, you know.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would have been better if I had called him out and shot him a year ago,”\r\n",

      "strong to say.\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity—with any sense of right—when\r\n",
      "the affair happens to be in his own family,” said Sir James, still in his white\r\n",
      "indignation. “It is perfectly scandalous. If Ladislaw had had a spark of honor\r\n",
      "he would have gone out of the country at once, and never shown his face in it\r\n",
      "again. However, I am not surprised. The day after Casaubon’s funeral I said\r\n",
      "what ought to be done. But I was not listened to.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke. “You\r\n",
      "wanted him shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as we liked\r\n",
      "with: he had his ideas. He was a remarkable fellow—I always said he was a\r\n",
      "remarkable fellow.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, “it is rather a pity you\r\n",
      "formed that high opinion of him. We are indebted to that for his being lodged\r\n",
      "in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing a woman like Dorothea\r\n",
      "degrading herself by marrying him.” Sir James made little stoppages between his\r\n",
      "clauses, the words not coming easily. “A man so marked out by her husband’s\r\n",
      "will, that delicacy ought to have forbidden her from seeing him again—who takes\r\n",
      "her out of her proper rank—into poverty—has the meanness to accept such a\r\n",
      "sacrifice—has always had an objectionable position—a bad origin—and, I\r\n",
      "believe, is a man of little principle and light character. That is my\r\n",
      "opinion.” Sir James ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his leg.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I pointed everything out to her,” said Mr. Brooke, apologetically—“I mean the\r\n",
      "poverty, and abandoning her position. I said, ‘My dear, you don’t know what it\r\n",
      "is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no carriage, and that kind of\r\n",
      "thing, and go amongst people who don’t know who you are.’ I put it strongly to\r\n",
      "her. But I advise you to talk to Dorothea herself. The fact is, she has a\r\n",
      "dislike to Casaubon’s property. You will hear what she says, you know.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—excuse me—I shall not,” said Sir James, with more coolness. “I cannot bear\r\n",
      "to see her again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much that a woman like\r\n",
      "Dorothea should have done what is wrong.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be just, Chettam,” said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to all\r\n",
      "this unnecessary discomfort. “Mrs. Casaubon may be acting imprudently: she is\r\n",
      "giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we men have so poor an opinion\r\n",
      "of each other that we can hardly call a woman wise who does that. But I think\r\n",
      "you should not condemn it as a wrong action, in the strict sense of the word.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do,” answered Sir James. “I think that Dorothea commits a wrong action\r\n",
      "in marrying Ladislaw.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it is\r\n",
      "unpleasant to us,” said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take life\r\n",
      "easily, he had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to those who felt\r\n",
      "themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out his handkerchief and\r\n",
      "began to bite the corner.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down here to woo her with his\r\n",
      "philanthropy, he might have carried her off before the year was over. There was\r\n",
      "no safety in anything else. Mr. Casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully\r\n",
      "as possible. He made himself disagreeable—or it pleased God to make him so—and\r\n",
      "then he dared her to contradict him. It’s the way to make any trumpery\r\n",

      "“He’s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I must speak for\r\n",
      "myself,” he continued, carefully keeping his eyes off Mr. Brooke. “I suppose\r\n",

      "thing.”\r\n",

      "“Well, you know, Chettam,” said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his leg, “I\r\n",
      "can’t turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her up to a certain\r\n",
      "point. I said, ‘My dear, I won’t refuse to give you away.’ I had spoken\r\n",
      "strongly before. But I can cut off the entail, you know. It will cost money and\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he was both showing his own force\r\n",
      "of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet’s vexation. He had\r\n",
      "hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he was aware of. He had touched a\r\n",
      "motive of which Sir James was ashamed. The mass of his feeling about Dorothea’s\r\n",
      "marriage to Ladislaw was due partly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable\r\n",
      "opinion, partly to a jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw’s case than in\r\n",
      "Casaubon’s. He was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea.\r\n",
      "But amid that mass ran a vein of which he was too good and honorable a man to\r\n",
      "like the avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of the two\r\n",
      "estates—Tipton and Freshitt—lying charmingly within a ring-fence, was a\r\n",
      "prospect that flattered him for his son and heir. Hence when Mr. Brooke\r\n",
      "noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt a sudden embarrassment; there\r\n",
      "was a stoppage in his throat; he even blushed. He had found more words than\r\n",
      "usual in the first jet of his anger, but Mr. Brooke’s propitiation was more\r\n",
      "clogging to his tongue than Mr. Cadwallader’s caustic hint.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her uncle’s suggestion of the\r\n",
      "marriage ceremony, and she said, though with as little eagerness of manner as\r\n",
      "if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, “Do you mean that Dodo\r\n",
      "is going to be married directly, uncle?”\r\n",

      "Rector, who said—\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should not make any fuss about it. If she likes to be poor, that is\r\n",
      "her affair. Nobody would have said anything if she had married the young fellow\r\n",
      "because he was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are poorer than they will be.\r\n",
      "Here is Elinor,” continued the provoking husband; “she vexed her friends by me:\r\n",
      "I had hardly a thousand a-year—I was a lout—nobody could see anything in me—my\r\n",
      "shoes were not the right cut—all the men wondered how a woman could like me.\r\n",

      "“Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,” said his wife. “Everything\r\n",

      "by any other name?”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a clergyman too,” observed Lady Chettam with approbation. “Elinor cannot\r\n",

      "because he had such a great soul, and was so old and dismal and learned; and\r\n",
      "now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has got no estate or anything. I\r\n",

      "happiness as “a reward”—she did not say for what, but probably she meant that\r\n",
      "it was a reward for her patience with Tertius, whose temper never became\r\n",
      "faultless, and to the last occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more\r\n",

      "that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that\r\n",
      "she should give him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so\r\n",
      "substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of\r\n",
      "another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother. But no one\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But this opinion of his did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way in\r\n",
      "which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all concerned. Mr.\r\n",
      "Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding with Will and Dorothea;\r\n",
      "and one morning when his pen had been remarkably fluent on the prospects of\r\n",
      "Municipal Reform, it ran off into an invitation to the Grange, which, once\r\n",
      "written, could not be done away with at less cost than the sacrifice (hardly to\r\n",
      "be conceived) of the whole valuable letter. During the months of this\r\n",
      "correspondence Mr. Brooke had continually, in his talk with Sir James Chettam,\r\n",
      "been presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail was\r\n",
      "still maintained; and the day on which his pen gave the daring invitation, he\r\n",
      "went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he had a stronger sense than ever\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter had come\r\n",
      "to Celia which made her cry silently as she read it; and when Sir James, unused\r\n",
      "to see her in tears, asked anxiously what was the matter, she burst out in a\r\n",
      "wail such as he had never heard from her before.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her. And I am\r\n",
      "sure she wants to see me. And she will not know what to do with the baby—she\r\n",
      "will do wrong things with it. And they thought she would die. It is very\r\n",
      "dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little Arthur, and Dodo had been hindered\r\n",
      "from coming to see me! I wish you would be less unkind, James!”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens, Celia!” said Sir James, much wrought upon, “what do you wish? I\r\n",
      "will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow if you wish it.”\r\n",
      "And Celia did wish it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the grounds,\r\n",
      "began to chat with him in ignorance of the news, which Sir James for some\r\n",
      "reason did not care to tell him immediately. But when the entail was touched on\r\n",
      "in the usual way, he said, “My dear sir, it is not for me to dictate to you,\r\n",
      "but for my part I would let that alone. I would let things remain as they are.”\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",

      "particular.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such being the bent of Celia’s heart, it was inevitable that Sir James should\r\n",
      "consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her husband. Where women love\r\n",
      "each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike. Sir James never liked\r\n",
      "Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir James’s company mixed with\r\n",
      "another kind: they were on a footing of reciprocal tolerance which was made\r\n",
      "quite easy only when Dorothea and Celia were present.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at least\r\n",
      "two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came gradually a small row\r\n",
      "of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with the two cousins visiting Tipton\r\n",
      "as much as if the blood of these cousins had been less dubiously mixed.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea’s second marriage as a mistake; and\r\n",
      "indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in Middlemarch, where she was\r\n",
      "spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly\r\n",
      "clergyman, old enough to be her father, and in little more than a year after\r\n",
      "his death gave up her estate to marry his cousin—young enough to have been his\r\n",
      "son, with no property, and not well-born. Those who had not seen anything of\r\n",
      "Dorothea usually observed that she could not have been “a nice woman,” else she\r\n",
      "would not have married either the one or the other.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They\r\n",
      "were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the\r\n",
      "conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often\r\n",
      "take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is\r\n",
      "no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined\r\n",
      "by what lies outside it. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of\r\n",

      "the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the\r\n",

    "None of the above analysis adequately substitutes for reading the book itself! Nonetheless, I have found the exercise useful, and succeeded in verifying the majority of Maria Antoniak's 13 recommendations. In particular, I have learned to train LDA models using the tomotopy (or gensim) package rather than sklearn, and to use the pyLDAvis package for impressive visual outputs. Ultimately, I am dissuaded from LDA topic modeling by the necessity of having human subjects for word intruder/document intruder tests of coherence. However, these methods are welcome additions to my unstructured data analysis toolkit, and I may use them going forward as part of a detailed exploratory data analysis. "
